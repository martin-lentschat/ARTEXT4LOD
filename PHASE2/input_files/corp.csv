0,A comparison on gas separation between PES (polyethersulfone) MMT (Na-montmorillonite) and PES TiO2 mixed matrix membranes.xml,['abstract']," Polyethersulfone (PES)-based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with the incorporation of inorganic fillers of different shapes (lamellar Na-montmorillonite (MMT) clays and spherical TiO2 nanoparticles) were prepared in this study, and the resulting MMMs were characterized by TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, and TEM. It was found that inorganic filler agglomeration became more serious at higher-filler-content MMMs. In the case of PES / MMT MMMs, both the CO2 and CH4 permeabilities increased significantly with the increasing filler content and consequently the gas selectivity was greatly reduced. At high MMT loadings (⩾10 wt.% ), Knudsen diffusion became the predominant gas transport mechanism. A different trend was achieved in the case of PES / TiO2 MMMs. The CO2 / CH4 selectivity increased from 24.5 (pure PES membrane) to a maximum value of 38.5 at 4 wt.% TiO2 MMM and then decreased with a further increase in TiO2 content (e.g. 17.3 for 20 wt.% ). The formation of interface voids and membrane defects in MMMs contributed to the high gas permeabilities and low gas selectivity. "

6,A comparison on gas separation between PES (polyethersulfone) MMT (Na-montmorillonite) and PES TiO2 mixed matrix membranes.xml,['Introduction']," Polymeric membranes have been widely applied to gas separation owing to their low price, good thermostability, economical processability, and high energy efficiency [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. However, they usually suffer a trade-off limitation between gas permeability and selectivity, revealed as the Robeson upper-bound relationship [1], [3], [4], [6], [7]. An alternative approach to resolve this problem is mixed matrix membrane (MMM) which may improve both permeability and selectivity of gases [7]. MMMs for gas separation usually contain inorganic fillers in an organic polymer matrix. By the inorganic / organic combination, they could offer better physical, thermal, and mechanical properties [1], [3]. The inorganic fillers incorporated and presented in the literature include zeolites, silicas / silicalites, clays, carbon molecular sieves, activated carbons, carbon nanotubes, metal oxides nanoparticles, etc. [1], [3], [4], [8], [9], [10], [11]. In this study, polyethersulfone (PES), a glassy polymer, was chosen as the base polymer for preparing flat-sheet gas separation MMMs because it is commercially available and has been adopted in the literature [4], [12], [13], [14]. There are several factors influencing the flat MMM performance, including inorganic filler type, filler particle size, particle agglomeration, polymer / filler interface morphology, etc. [1], [15]. Moreover, four kinds of nanoscale interface morphology have been observed and categorized as: ideal morphology, interface voids, rigidified polymer layer, and filler pore blockage [1], [15]. Case 1 (ideal morphology) represents a perfect attachment of polymer on the surface of inorganic filler. Case 2 (interface voids) indicates the interface voids caused by the detachment of polymer chains from the filler surface. Case 3 (rigidified polymer layer) specifies the rigidification of polymer chains in direct contact with the filler surface. Case 4 (filler pore blockage) points out the blockage of filler pores by the polymer chains. Cases 2-4 are different types of interface defects. Morphology type, usually dominated by the interaction between inorganic filler and polymer, could strongly affect the gas transport properties of MMMs. Sometimes, the filler-polymer interaction could be improved via chemical (e.g. addition of coupling agent or chemical modification on external filler surface) and physical (addition of additive) methods [14]. Two inexpensive inorganic fillers with different shapes, sodium montmorillonite (MMT) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), were employed in this work for the preparation of PES-based MMMs. MMT, a member of the smectite family, is composed of layers with two silica tetrahedral sheets sandwiching a central alumina octahedral sheet [16]. It has a basal spacing of 12-14 Å [17], [18], [19], [20]. TiO2 is nonporous spherical nanoparticles. These two inorganic fillers possess high hydrophilicity as well as good chemical and thermal stabilities [21], [22], but different structures. Although some former studies [16], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] have investigated the MMMs with these two fillers, they did not use PES as the base polymer material and adopt these two fillers at the same time for evaluating the possible influences contributing from the filler shape. The present study, therefore, focuses on preparing the PES / MMT and PES / TiO2 MMMs for CO2 and CH4 permeations. A comparison in CO2 / CH4 selectivity between MMT and TiO2 fillers was investigated.

16,A comparison on gas separation between PES (polyethersulfone) MMT (Na-montmorillonite) and PES TiO2 mixed matrix membranes.xml,"['Experimental', 'Gas permeation experiment']"," Gas permeation experiment was conducted in a cell which is divided into two parts by a membrane with the effective diameter 52 mm (membrane area = 21.2 cm^2). The schematic drawing of apparatus has been presented in details elsewhere [29]. A constant pressure p1 was maintained at the feed side (2 bar), while a vacuum was set at the permeate side (volume V2) in the beginning of experiment.

Finally, the ideal CO2 / CH4 selectivity was decided by CO2 permeability / CH4 permeability. "
17,A comparison on gas separation between PES (polyethersulfone) MMT (Na-montmorillonite) and PES TiO2 mixed matrix membranes.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Characterization of PES/MMT and PES/TiO2 membranes']"," The properties of PES / MMT and PES / TiO2 MMMs are listed in Table 1. The MMM thickness values (21-27 μm for PES / MMT MMMs and 20-23 μm for PES / TiO2 MMMs) are very close to that of pristine PES membrane. Thereby, membrane thickness would not be a factor affecting the gas permeation performance in this study. Fig. 1 presents the TGA results. Compared to the pure PES membrane, the TGA curves for PES / inorganic filler MMMs shifted toward a higher temperature. The T5% (temperature for 5% weight loss) values are listed in Table 1. All the MMMs had higher T5% than the pure PES membrane, indicating that the MMMs exhibited enhanced thermal stabilities. This improvement should be attributed to the inherently good thermal properties of inorganic fillers. Moreover, T5% increased with increasing inorganic filler loading. More heat was absorbed by a greater amount of inorganic fillers in MMM during heating-up, the membrane decomposition was thus delayed and the decomposition temperature was raised. The Tg results are also displayed in Table 1. The Tg of MMM increased gradually with the incorporation of higher inorganic filler content. It should be noted that Tg may be able to provide a qualitative evaluation of polymer chain flexibility in MMM [1], [9], [12]. The MMM with polymer chain rigidification (Case 3) should have a higher Tg than the pure polymer membrane. However, for the PES / TiO2 MMMs and the PES / MMT MMMs at 2 and 4 wt.% loadings, the difference of Tg from the pure PES membrane is ⩽5 °C. The polymer chain rigidification for these MMMs is minor in comparison with the PES / MMT MMMs at 10 and 20 wt.% loadings. The XRD results are depicted in Fig. 2. The PES polymer is amorphous so that the pure PES membrane showed only one XRD peak at 2θ = 18.04^o, which is similar to the literature results [4], [21], [30]. The basal reflection characteristic of the pristine MMT clay was obtained at 2θ = 6.30^o (basal spacing ≈ 14.01 Å), whereas the five characteristic peaks of TiO2 particles are exhibited at 2θ ≈ 25.28^o, 27.42^o, 36.02^o, 48.04^o, and 54.34^o. These results are also close to those reported in the literature [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [30], [31]. All the MMMs displayed the characteristic peaks induced from the inorganic filler incorporation in addition to the peak of pure PES. The TiO2 peak locations for the PES / TiO2 MMMs were not changed, compared to those of pristine TiO2 particle. The interaction between polymer chains and TiO2 particles should be negligible. However, the MMT peaks of the PES / MMT MMMs were shifted to left slightly, indicating that the layer spacing of MMT filled in MMM (about 15.06-15.49 Å, Table 1) became somewhat wider than the unmingled clay. This phenomenon may be attributed to the intercalation of polymer chain into the interlamellar layer of clay [18]. The morphology and inorganic filler distribution of MMMs were observed by SEM and TEM, and the related images are shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. Obviously, inorganic filler particles agglomerated together even at low loading ratios. This phenomenon was similar to those reported in the literature [20], [23], [24], [25], [32]. With the increasing inorganic filler content in MMM, filler particle aggregation became more significant and bigger agglomerates were formed [23], [24]. In order to analyze the MMT agglomerate morphology, the value of average aspect ratio was determined from their TEM images and the results are listed in Table 1. Using the categories defined in Ref. [24] and comparing to their aspect ratio data, only PES / 2% MMT MMM exhibited smaller agglomerates (5-10 sheets tactoids, aspect ratio ≈ 20) in this study. Higher MMT loading ratios led to the formation of middle and micron size agglomerates (aspect ratio ⩽ 10). Big-size agglomerates were also perceived from the SEM photos with large magnification. Moreover, interface voids were observed in the MMMs with high filler loadings (see the SEM photos with large magnification). This phenomenon may be attributed to poor adhesion between hydrophobic PES and hydrophilic inorganic fillers. Interface void morphology was also indicated for the polyetherimide / 1 wt.% raw MMT MMM [25]. "

23,A comparison on gas separation between PES (polyethersulfone) MMT (Na-montmorillonite) and PES TiO2 mixed matrix membranes.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Gas permeation performance of PES/MMT and PES/TiO2 MMMs']"," Fig. 5 presents the gas sorption results for the pristine MMT clays and TiO2 particles. It is clearly shown that, for both inorganic fillers, the CO2 uptake was a little bit higher than the CH4 uptake. However, the uptake amounts onto these fillers were very low such that gas sorption effect during the gas permeation through the prepared MMMs may be neglected. In this study, transport of CO2 or CH4 through the PES / inorganic filler MMM was investigated at room temperature by dynamic permeation method. Fig. 6, Fig. 7 illustrate the gas permeability and selectivity results, respectively. The CH4 flux through the pure PES membrane (without inorganic fillers) was very low so that the related measurement was performed only in a narrow p2 interval (0-0.1 bar). The CO2 permeability (1.97 barrer), CH4 permeability (0.08 barrer), and ideal CO2 / CH4 selectivity (24.5) for the pure PES membrane are in good agreement with the literature data [13], [14]. With the addition of MMT clays in MMM, the CO2 permeability increased initially for 2 wt.% loading (7.15 barrer), decreased slightly at 4 wt.% (4.06 barrer), and then increased greatly at higher MMT contents. As for the CH4 permeability, it increased with the increasing MMT loading amount and became even larger than the CO2 permeability when the MMT content was >10 wt.% . Consequently, the CO2 / CH4 selectivity decreased significantly from 24.5 to 0.38 (relative selectivity = 0.016). For 10 and 20 wt.% MMT loadings, the values of CO2 / CH4 selectivity were close to that of Knudsen selectivity (ca. 0.60, inverse to the square root of the diffusant molecular weight [1]). It means that Knudsen transport is the predominant mechanism in these cases. Regarding to the increasing gas permeabilities for the PES / MMT MMMs, it should result from the interface void morphology (Case 2). Similar phenomenon has been revealed in the study using polyetherimide / 1 wt.% raw MMT MMM with a relative CO2 / CH4 selectivity of 0.04 [25]. When the MMT content was added to 10 wt.% or higher, the agglomeration of MMT clays became very serious (as shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4). It may have caused the formation of pinholes or other defects in the MMM which could not be reached by polymer chains [1]. In such cases, gas permeation would be significantly enhanced and the Knudsen transport became the governing mechanism. Although the polymer chain rigidification (Case 3) may also happen based on the increase of Tg in the PES / 10-20% MMT MMMs, its effect on gas permeation turned out to be unimportant. As discussed in the membrane characterization section, the MMT clays in MMMs formed 5-10 sheets tactoids, middle or micron size agglomerates with enlarged layer spacing. In the literature [24], MMT and their organo-clays are considered as impermeable fillers and the agglomerates usually lead to the enhanced tortuosity effect and barrier property (based on ideal morphology). However, in the current study, the gas permeabilities were increased significantly and the relative selectivity was reduced a lot. It is evident that the void morphology has been created from the MMT agglomerates with poor polymer-MMT adhesion. Similar observable result has been reported in the polymer / raw MMT MMM study [25], too. In Fig. 8, the PES / MMT MMM data are compared to Robeson upper bounds. It is clearly shown that the data point is shifted from upper left to lower right with the increasing MMT content. However, all the PES / MMT MMM data are far from the upper bounds, mainly due to the formation of plenty of interface voids and other defects. Knudsen diffusion is the dominant mechanism for the lowest two points. In the case of PES / TiO2 MMMs, both the CO2 and CH4 permeabilities increased with the increasing TiO2 content, except that a minimum value of CH4 permeability (0.07 barrer) was obtained at PES / 4 wt.% TiO2. It resulted in a different trend for the CO2 / CH4 selectivity compared to the PES / MMT MMMs. In Fig. 7, the relative CO2 / CH4 selectivity for the PES / TiO2 MMMs increased at low TiO2 weight percentages and then decreased with a further increase in TiO2 content. Different from the case of MMT filler, the value of selectivity was still high even for high TiO2 loading (17.3 for 20 wt.% ). It should be noted that the results for 6 wt.% TiO2 loading are also included in Fig. 6, Fig. 7 in order to more clearly elucidate the filler loading effect on gas permeabilities and selectivity. Based on the above gas permeation performance, the interface morphology for the PES / TiO2 MMMs may be divided into: Case 1 (ideal morphology) for ⩽8 wt.% loading and Case 2 (interface voids) for >8 wt.% loading. At 2 wt.% TiO2 incorporation, there existed a fair attachment of polymer on the nonporous TiO2 particle surface such that the gas permeabilities and selectivity of the MMM were almost identical to the results of the pure polymer membrane. Interpreted from the gas permeability variation in Fig. 6, interactions of CO2 with TiO2 particles were stronger than CH4-TiO2 interactions when 4-6 wt.% TiO2 was filled in the MMM. Similar trend has been reported in the literature using the poly(amide-imide) / TiO2 (7.3% ) MMM [15], [26], as well as shown in the gas sorption plot (Fig. 5). Subsequently, the CO2 / CH4 selectivity for these MMMs was larger than that of pure PES membrane and the relative selectivity value was up to 1.5 (Fig. 7). When further increasing the TiO2 content, particle aggregation became more significant and the interface voids were created by the detachment of polymer chains (more hydrophobic) from the particle surface (hydrophilic), resulting in higher gas permeabilities and lower selectivity. On the other hand, in comparison with the layer structure of MMT clay, less voids or defects were produced by the incorporation of nonporous spherical TiO2 nanoparticles. Thus, the CO2 / CH4 selectivity for the PES / high TiO2 wt.% MMMs was not reduced dramatically. Their selectivity remained at an acceptable value. The PES / TiO2 MMM results plus the data from the Matrimid5218 / TiO2 MMM literature [23] are compared to Robeson upper bounds in Fig. 8. Our data points are located in a range nearby the literature results, but they are not close to the Robeson upper bounds. The highest CO2 / CH4 selectivity in the present work (38.5) is obtained from the PES / 4 wt.% TiO2 MMM, with CO2 permeability of 2.61 barrer and CH4 permeability of 0.07 barrer. In the study using the Matrimid5218 / TiO2 MMM for gas permeation [23], Moghadam et al. found that the CO2 / CH4 selectivity decreased from 20.5 (0 vol.% TiO2) to about 7 (25 vol.% TiO2) while the CO2 and CH4 permeabilities increased from 4.3 to 12 barrer and from 0.21 to 1.84 barrer, respectively. In comparison with their results, our PES / 4 wt.% TiO2 MMM exhibited a higher CO2 / CH4 selectivity but lower gas permeabilities. However, the performance of PES / 20 wt.% TiO2 MMM (selectivity of 17.3, CO2 permeability of 5.67 barrer, and CH4 permeability of 0.33 barrer) is close to theirs. "

28,A comparison on gas separation between PES (polyethersulfone) MMT (Na-montmorillonite) and PES TiO2 mixed matrix membranes.xml,['Conclusions']," PES / MMT and PES / TiO2 MMMs at various filler weight fractions were prepared and used for gas transport in this study. SEM and TEM images revealed the inorganic filler agglomeration in MMMs. The agglomerate size became bigger at higher filler content, and interface voids between filler and polymer were formed. For the PES / MMT MMMs, both the CO2 and CH4 permeabilities were greatly raised with the increasing MMT content. This phenomenon should be attributed to the big gas transport path created by the interface voids and other defects. Accordingly, the gas selectivity was very low and far from the Robeson upper bounds. Especially when the incorporated MMT content was ⩾10 wt.% , Knudsen diffusion became the predominant gas transport mechanism such that CO2 and CH4 could hardly be separated. A different trend was achieved in the case of PES / TiO2 MMMs. Their CO2 / CH4 selectivity increased at lower TiO2 contents and then decreased with a further increase in TiO2 amount. The relative gas selectivity values for the MMMs with ⩽8 wt.% TiO2 were greater than 1 and could rise up to 1.5 (4 wt.% TiO2), implying the occurrence of ideal interface morphology with stronger TiO2-CO2 interactions. Based on identical incorporation amount, the MMMs filled with 70 nm spherical TiO2 particles accomplished better gas separation performances than those filled with lamellar MMT sheets of mean length = 500 nm. Even for the inclusion of 20 wt.% filler, the use of nonporous TiO2 nanoparticles created less voids and defects on the MMM such that its CO2 / CH4 selectivity (17.3) is still satisfactory. To improve the PES / MMT MMM performance, middle and micron size agglomerates as well as interface voids should be avoided. Several methods suggested in the literature may be helpful for preparing the MMMs with more uniform MMT distribution and less aggregation and defects: sonication method for a better inorganic filler distribution in solution [23], [25], [33], filler surface modification for enhanced interactions with polymer [15], employment of organo-MMT clays [24], [25], melt processing in membrane preparation [15], [24], etc. "
29,A method for the measurement of the oxygen permeability and the development of edible films to reduce the rate of oxidative reactions in fresh foods.xml,['abstract']," A method involving the flow of O2 and N2 gasses from the two sides of an edible film coupled with a simple wet chemical analysis at the end, was developed to measure the oxygen permeability of edible films. The proposed method was employed to determine the oxygen permeability of methyl cellulose (MC)-based edible films of various composition with the aim of finding the optimum composition for minimising oxidative degradation of foods. The effects of the presence of stearic acid (SA), ascorbic acid (AA) and citric acid (CA), in varying amounts in the film composition, on the oxygen permeability (OP) of MC based edible films were examined. The OP increased with increasing SA content of the film and decreased with the inclusion of AA or CA in the film composition. The films, with various compositions and with the measured oxygen permeabilities, were then applied to mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) and cauliflower (Brassica botrytis). It was found, from the analysis of these coated foods, that the coatings containing antioxidants slowed the browning reactions and reduced the vitamin C loss in both foods, the effects being greater in cauliflower. Moreover, the moisture loss of coated foods was less than that of uncoated. "

35,A method for the measurement of the oxygen permeability and the development of edible films to reduce the rate of oxidative reactions in fresh foods.xml,['Introduction']," The development of edible films to reduce the moisture transfer, the oxidation or the respiration in food systems is important to prolong the shelf-lives of foods. The measurements of permeabilities of stand-alone films to water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide are important tools for the development of edible films. Oxygen is involved in many degradation reactions in foods, such as fat and oil rancidity, micro-organism growth, enzymatic browning and vitamin loss. Thus, many packaging strategies seek to exclude oxygen to protect the food product (Gontard, Thibault, Cuq, & Guilbert, 1996). On the other hand, the permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide is essential for respiration in living tissues such as fresh fruits and vegetables. So, moderate barrier coatings are more appropriate. If a coating with the appropriate permeability is chosen, a controlled respiratory exchange can be established and thus the preservation of fresh fruits and vegetables can be prolonged. The main characteristics to consider in the selection of coating materials are their oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour permeabilities. The water vapour permeability (WVP) is the most extensively studied property of edible films (Ayranci et al., 1997, Ayranci and Cetin, 1995, Gontard et al., 1995, Kamper and Fennema, 1984, McHugh et al., 1994) mainly because of the importance of the role of water in deteriorative reactions and partly because the ease of measurement. The correlation between moisture sorption isotherm and WVP of cellulose-based edible films was also sought (Ayranci, 1996). The measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide permeabilities requires instruments which may not be easily available. Measurements are mostly based on the standard method described in ASTM (1988) for oxygen gas transmission through films. These methods involve a flowing an oxygen gas stream on one side of the film and a nitrogen stream, to carry the transmitted oxygen gas to the analyzer, on the other side. A coulometric sensor, an infrared sensor, a gas chromatograph or a dedicated oxygen analyser may be used for monitoring. Park, Weller, Wergano, and Testin (1993) measured the oxygen permeabilities of methyl cellulose (MC) and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPC)-based edible films by the OX-TRAN 1000 system, operated according to the ASTM (1988) standard method. They found that the oxygen permeability (OP) of the films increased with the molecular weight of MC and HPC. In another work by Gennadios, Weller, and Testin (1993), the OP of corn zein, wheat gluten and wheat gluten / soy protein isolate films was measured at 7, 15, 25 and 35 °C by a method again based on ASTM (1988). The OP of all films was found to increase with temperature. It was also noted that the OP values of wheat gluten / soy protein isolate films were lower than those of other films. The degree of resistance of various lipid films to the oxygen transmission was measured with the aim of determining the influences of polymorphic forms of the lipid and of tempering, using the method of ASTM by Kester and Fennema, 1989a, Kester and Fennema, 1989b, Kester and Fennema, 1989c. Greener and Fennema (1989) reported oxygen permeabilities of bilayer films prepared from methyl cellulose and beeswax measured by the same method. Another work on the oxygen transmission of a methyl cellulose-palmitic acid film was reported by Rico-Pena and Torres (1990). In a recent work from our laboratory, a simple method was proposed for the measurement of CO2 permeability (Ayranci, Tunc, & Etci, 1999) and applied successfully to various cellulose-based edible films (Ayranci & Tunc, 2001). In the present work, we introduce a method to measure the OP of edible films. The proposed method was applied to measure the OP of films of various composition with the aim of finding the optimum composition to minimise oxidative degradation of foods. Application of film solutions to fresh foods, such as mushrooms and cauliflower, and analysis of these foods for oxidative degradation, are also investigated. "

38,A method for the measurement of the oxygen permeability and the development of edible films to reduce the rate of oxidative reactions in fresh foods.xml,"['Materials and methods', 'Measurement of the OP']"," An edible film was sealed between two specially designed glass cups, each having a diameter of 4 cm and a depth of 5 cm (Fig. 1). Both cups have two channels. Oxygen enters to the cup on one side of the film from one channel and leaves from the other with a controlled flow rate to keep the oxygen pressure constant in that compartment. The cup on the other side of the film was purged by a stream of nitrogen entering from one channel and leaving from the other. This nitrogen acted as a carrier for oxygen permeated from the other side of the film to the wet analysis system (Fig. 1). Up to the wet analysis system, the design was mainly based on the ASTM standard (1988). A modification was made to the O2 analysis and a classical wet analysis, based on the well-known method of iodimetry was applied for the determination of the amount of permeated O2, instead of using an oxygen analyser as in the ASTM standard, which uses a coulometric sensor. The mixture of N2 and permeated O2 was passed from the wet system for a known period of time. Then the wet system, which originally contained aqueous manganese(II) sulphate and alkaline iodide solution, was analysed for O2 (Vogel, 1989). It is well known that manganese(II) hydroxide is rapidly and quantitatively converted to manganese(III) hydroxide with oxygen by the following reaction:4MnOH2+O2+2H2O→4MnOH3↓ The brown precipitate formed was dissolved on acidification and allowed to oxidise iodide ions present in the system quantitatively to iodine ;MnOH3+I-+3H+→Mn2++12I2+3H2O The liberated iodine could then be titrated with a standard thiosulphate solution;2S2O32-+I2→S4O62-+2I- A blank titration was carried out to determine any oxygen pre-dissolved in the wet system. The stoichiometry indicated that 1 mol of dissolved oxygen required 4 mol of thiosulphate. The OP of the film was then calculated by Eq. (1);(1)OP=m dA t ΔPwhere m is the mass of O2 permeated through the film with a thickness of d and an area of A over the measured time interval t. ΔP is the difference in O2 pressure between the two sides of the film. The pressure on the O2 side of the film (Fig. 1) was kept at 1 atm by controlling the flow of pure O2 purged to this compartment and by measuring its pressure with a Hg manometer (Fig. 1). The O2 pressure on the N2 side of the film was assumed to be zero, since any O2 permeated through the film was continuously swept to the wet system for analysis at the end. So, ΔP was taken as 1 atm. The OP of various edible films were determined according to the method described above at 25±1 °C and 0% relative humidity. Both O2 and N2 gases were dried by passing through a gas drying column containing anhydrous calcium chloride before entering the system (Fig. 1). Prior to the permeability measurements, films were also conditioned in a desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride for 1 day. "

41,A method for the measurement of the oxygen permeability and the development of edible films to reduce the rate of oxidative reactions in fresh foods.xml,"['Materials and methods', 'Comparison of the OP results obtained by the present method with those reported in literature']"," The data on OP, determined by ASTM methods in the literature, are reported at varying conditions of temperature, film thickness, film composition and relative humidity. It should be recognised that it is very difficult to match all these conditions exactly for OP measurements in different laboratories to compare or test the results obtained by a new method. However, a reasonable comparison can be made between the reported OP data and the data obtained in this work, under slightly different conditions, in order to seek support for the validity of the method. Rico-Pena and Torres’ (1990) OP data, reported for a film with a composition of PA:MC:PEG in 3:9:1 ratio, was taken as the first reference to compare with the results obtained in the present method. The film used in the reference work had a thickness of 54 μm and its OP was measured at 24 °C and 0% relative humidity as 0.52×10^-9 g d^-1 Pa^-1 m^-1. The film prepared in the present work, for comparison purposes, had the same composition. Its OP was measured at the same temperature and relative humidity. However, the thickness of the film could only be adjusted to 42 μm which is 12 μm thinner than Rico-Pena and Torres’ film. The measured OP was (0.82±0.05)×10^-9 g d^-1 Pa^-1 m^-1 which has the same order of magnitude but is greater than Rico-Pena and Torres’ reported value. The difference is believed to originate from the difference in thickness of the two films. It was reported by Park and Chinnan (1990) that O2 and CO2 permeabilities of protein based films increase with decreasing thickness. The second selected reference OP was reported by Park and Chinnan (1990) for a film with a composition of MC:PEG in 9:1 ratio and with a thickness of 40 μm. The OP of this film was found to be 0.21×10^-9 g d^-1 Pa^-1 m^-1 at 30 °C and 0% relative humidity. The control film prepared in the present work had the same composition and the same thickness. Its OP was measured at 29 °C and 0% relative humidity as (0.52±0.03)×10^-9 g d^-1 Pa^-1 m^-1, which again has the same order of magnitude but is greater than the reported result of Park and Chinnan. This time the difference in conditions seems to be only in temperature and that is only 1 °C, which can not explain the large difference observed in OP values. This large difference can only be attributed to the origin of MC used in the film preparation. The MC used in the present work has an average molecular weight of 41 000. Unfortunately, the molecular weight of MC used by Park and Chinnan was not reported. It might be different. Ayranci et al. (1997) found the effective molecular weight of MC on WVP of MC-based edible films to be especially important above 41 000. The OP values of edible films measured with the proposed method, in the present work, have the same order of magnitude as those reported in the literature. Some differences may arise due to the differences in conditions of measurements and composition or thickness of the films. It is noteworthy that the OP values determined with the proposed method, for a series of films, show the same trend even if there are some differences in absolute values from those in literature. "

49,A method for the measurement of the oxygen permeability and the development of edible films to reduce the rate of oxidative reactions in fresh foods.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'The effect of antioxidants on the OP of edible films containing SA']"," Fatty acids, such as SA, LA and PA, being edible and having hydrophobic character, are used in coating formulations as water vapour barrier materials. In previous work we had found SA to be more effective than LA and PA for decreasing WVP of cellulose-based edible films (Ayranci and Tunc, 1997, Ayranci and Tunc, 2001). Therefore, it was of interest to see how the OP of these films was affected by the SA content. The OP values of MC-based edible films, containing varying amounts of SA in their composition, were determined by the method developed in the present work, as described earlier, and are given in Table 2, together with film thickness values. The general trend is that the OP increases with increasing SA content of the film. This may be attributed to the formation of holes in the crystal structure of edible films as the SA content increases. These holes, which are especially formed above 15 g SA / 100 g MC, may facilitate the permeation of oxygen. A similar result was also reported by Park et al. (1993). They found the OP values of laminated films to increase with increasing fatty acid content of the film. There seems to be a paradox here. Increasing the SA content of the film increases the desired water vapour barrier property but decreases the oxygen barrier property which is not so desirable. In order to improve the oxygen barrier property together with the water vapour barrier property, some antioxidants, such as AA and CA, could be added to the film composition, together with SA. Being antioxidants, AA or CA are expected to lower the OP of films. Varying amounts of AA and CA were included in the film composition containing a fixed amount of SA (20 g / 100 g MC), in order to examine their effects on the OP of the films. The antioxidant content, the thickness and the OP values of these films are given in Table 3. It is clear from Table 3 that OP values of films decrease with both AA and CA contents. The only exception to this trend is at 16.7 g CA / 100 g MC content. The OP values of this film were found to be slightly larger than that of the film with 3.33 g CA / 100 g MC. The two antioxidants show similar effects in improving the oxygen barrier property of the films. "

In the coating formulations, an intermediate SA content of 20 g / 100 g MC (which is equivalent to 0.6 g / 3 g MC) and the highest examined CA or AA content of 16.7 g / 100 g MC (which is equivalent to 0.5 g / 3 g MC) were maintained according to the results presented above in Section 3.1. The% water losses of uncoated mushrooms are 3.86, 14.7 and 19.7 at the end of first, third and fifth days, respectively. Mushrooms with coatings of varying composition have lower% water loss than uncoated ones, the effect of lowering the water loss being the greatest with the coating containing only SA (coating 2) as an additive. This is an expected result, due to the hydrophobicity provided to the coating by SA. The coating without SA (coating 1) is the least efficient in reducing water loss of mushrooms. The inclusion of AA and CA, in addition to SA in the coating formulation (coating 3 and coating 4), lowers the hydrophobicity of the coatings. Thus, mushrooms with these coatings have slightly larger water losses than those with the coating containing only SA (Fig. 2). The% water losses of cauliflower with the same coatings (Table 1) and of uncoated ones, as a function of time, are given in Fig. 3.

An L value of 100 means white colour, zero absorbance and 100% transmittance. L value decreases below 100 with increasing degree of browning of the product. L values of uncoated mushrooms, and of mushrooms with coatings of varying compositions (Table 1) as a function of time, are given in Fig. 4. Uncoated mushrooms had the lowest L values throughout the whole period of 4 days. The highest L values were maintained by mushrooms with the coating containing SA and AA (coating 3) during the same working period. So, it can be concluded that coating 3 is the most effective in preventing the browning of fresh mushrooms. The second most effective film appears to be coating 4, the one containing CA (Fig. 4). As mentioned in the experimental part, the browning of coated and uncoated cauliflower could only be followed by eye as a function of time because it was not possible to measure L values due to roughness of the surfaces. Again, minimum degree of browning was observed for cauliflower with coatings containing CA or AA (coating 3 and 4) throughout the 12-day observation period.

The results are given in Fig. 5 for mushrooms and in Fig. 6 for cauliflower. An increase in the vitamin C content was observed for mushrooms with coating 3 (with AA) on the first and second days (Fig. 5). This may result from the diffusion of AA present in the coating composition to the mushrooms in the first 2 days. After the second day, vitamin C contents of these mushrooms started to decrease. Percentage vitamin C loss of uncoated mushrooms was 49.8, and those of mushrooms with coatings 1, 2 and 4 were 43.9, 27.9 and 23.9, respectively, at the end of fourth day. It is evident that the coatings with CA or AA are the most effective in preserving the vitamin C content of mushrooms. This can be attributed to the low oxygen permeability of these coatings (Table 3) compared with the others. Keeping oxygen away from the food delays the deteriorative oxidation reactions of vitamin C. Mushrooms without coating or with coatings containing only MC and PEG (coating 1) maintained the lowest vitamin C content throughout the working period of 4 days (Fig. 5). It is noteworthy that the oxidation of ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid does not represent the loss of vitamin C, as both forms have the vitamin property. The loss of vitamin C, here, represents the conversion of dehydroascorbic acid to diketogulonic acid by further oxidation (Rai & Saxena, 1988). The variation in vitamin C content of cauliflower, as a function of time, given in Fig. 6, showed trends similar to those of mushrooms. Again, coatings with AA or CA (coatings 3 and 4) were the most effective in preserving vitamin C content of cauliflower. PPO activity and total phenol contents of foods are considered to be a measure of the degree of oxidation reactions. Oxidation increases with PPO activity since PPO acts as a catalyst in oxidation reactions. Similarly, increase in total phenol content indicates an increase in oxidation, since phenolic compounds are products of oxidation reactions. The variation of PPO activity as a function of time is given in Fig. 7 for mushrooms with and without coating, and in Fig. 8 for cauliflower with and without coating. In general there was an increase in PPO activity with time for all samples. However, it is clear that mushrooms and cauliflower with coatings containing AA or CA (coatings 3 and 4) maintained the lowest PPO activity compared to those which were uncoated or coated with other coatings. It should also be noted that there was a direct relation between the PPO activity and the degree of browning. The variation of total phenol content of only mushrooms with time could be followed and the results are presented in Fig. 9. Again, the effectiveness of coatings 3 and 4 (with AA and CA) in preserving mushrooms against oxidation could clearly be seen in this figure. Due to the naturally more stable character of cauliflower than mushrooms, against deterioration, the level of total phenol content of cauliflower was either undetectable or very low during the storage period of about 12 days. For example, the total phenol content of cauliflower, with coatings 2, 3 and 4 was undetectably low at the end of the 12th day, that of those with coating 1 was as low as 60 mg l^-1 at the end of the 9th day and that of those which were uncoated was 258 mg l^-1 at the end of the 12th day.

64,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,['abstract']," The thermomechanical properties and oxygen permeability of sorbitol-starch-water films were studied. Sorbitol had an antiplasticisation effect for contents below 21% (wt% ), as indicated by a ten-fold drop in oxygen permeability 1.43×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for the sample not containing sorbitol and 0.15×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for the sample containing 8.8% of sorbitol. This behaviour was related to changes in secondary relaxations. The motions involved in these relaxations were reduced because of the connections established between starch and sorbitol, leading to decreased diffusion of oxygen molecules. For sorbitol contents above 21% (wt% ), oxygen permeability increased slightly. Water produced a classic plasticising effect (an increase of oxygen permeability), but at low sorbitol content (8.8% ) this was only moderate due to the effect of sorbitol itself (4.3×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for 23.8% of water).

69,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,['Introduction']," Studies of the addition of plasticisers to starch were undertaken initially to decrease Tg below ambient temperature and obtain a supple and deformable rubbery material (Kalichevsky and Blanshard, 1993, Lourdin et al., 1997a, Orford et al., 1989). However, these additives can produce an antiplasticiser effect by inducing rigidification of the glassy material through a lowering of the yield at break and an increase of the modulus. This type of behaviour has been observed in synthetic polymers such as PVC-dioctylphthalate (Horsley, 1957) and PC-dibutylethylenedibenzoate (Jackson and Caldwell, 1967a, Jackson and Caldwell, 1967b) and was recently suspected with starch containing low glycerol (Lourdin, Bizot & Colonna, 1997b) or sorbitol content (Gaudin, Lourdin, Le Botlan, Ilari & Colonna, 1999). The cause has not been clearly elucidated, but it would appear that local molecular mobilities play a preponderant role in the mechanisms involved. In the case of the sorbitol-water-starch system, the molecular relaxations studied by DMTA and NMR time domain (Gaudin et al., 1999) showed local mobilities (relaxation β) for starch that were strongly affected by addition of small amounts of sorbitol. This phenomenon could be due to the disappearance of local molecular mobilities and the appearance of the intrinsic mobility of sorbitol, or to a coupling between the β relaxation of starch and the α relaxation of sorbitol. In any event, a decrease of local mobilities in starch has been observed by NMR measurements. Above 21% (total wt% ) of sorbitol and a water content corresponding to an equilibrium relative humidity of 0.57, the material behaves mechanically like rubber (i.e. a certain resistance to deformation), although this condition is not attributable to the lowering of Tg below ambient temperature. Though sorbitol has a depressing effect, the Tg value remains greater than 20 °C even for the highest sorbitol contents. It has been considered that plastic behaviour is due to the appearance of clusters of sorbitol which allow some mechanical plasticity. Reports concerning the antiplasticisation of the polycarbonate (Robeson, 1969), the polysulphones (Maeda and Paul, 1987a, Ruiz-Trevino and Paul, 1998), or the poly(phenyleneoxide) (Maeda & Paul, 1987b) indicate that a considerable modification in diffusional properties of gases such as O2 or CO2 occurs simultaneously with the increase of the mechanical modulus. For the starch-water system, Benczedi (1999) calculated free volume from experimental density measurements, observing a minimal free volume for a low water concentration (molar concentration between 0.288 and 0.640), which may be indicative of low permeability to gases. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the antiplasticisation effect revealed by the mechanical properties of starch induced changes in oxygen permeability, as in the case of the synthetic polymers cited earlier. "
70,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,"['Materials and methods', 'Film preparation']"," The starch used for film preparation was an A-type wheat starch (27% amylose, 73% amylopectin) of commercial origin (F33, Olgivie Aquitaine). Sorbitol of technical quality was obtained from Prolabo (94126 Fontenay-sous-Bois Cedex, France). For mechanical measurements, thick films (approximately 0.5 mm) were produced by thermomoulding to 140 °C during a 10 min mix of native starch, sorbitol and water. For permeability measurements, films were obtained by the casting method. Native wheat starch was solubilised in a high-pressure reactor at 138 °C for 20 min using a 6% (w / w) suspension in ultrapure water (resistivity 18.2 MW cm) containing sorbitol from 0 to 28% (wt% ). This procedure was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere to avoid any risk of degradation. The solution was then spread on a thermostated plate at 70 °C. After evaporation of the solvent, a film was obtained. After elaboration, the hydration of films containing various amounts of sorbitol was controlled by conditioning in different equilibrium relative humidities (ERH). "

Vibration frequency in bending mode was set at 1 Hz, and the heating rate at 3 °C / min. Films were coated with a silicone-based hydrophobic grease to limit dehydration during experiments above room temperature. It was determined that a thin coating of grease had no effect on thermomechanical properties. "

The test cell was composed of two chambers separated by the film (5 cm^2). Films were subjected to 100% oxygen on one side and nitrogen on the other. Nitrogen gas containing oxygen transferred through the film was conducted to the coulometric sensor. Measurements were made when oxygen flux was stabilised indicating that steady state was reached. The RH of the two gases was controlled by a humidifier. Temperature was 20 °C. "
73,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,"['Materials and methods', 'Assays']"," Determination of the residual content of water after evaporation was performed by the Karl-Fisher method on a Mettler DL 18. Sorbitol content was determined by ionic chromatography coupled to pulsed amperometric detection. Film samples (100 mg) were washed in ultrapure water (20 ml), with vigorous stirring to achieve complete leaching of the sorbitol in the solution. After centrifugation, the sorbitol in the supernatant was analysed using a DIONEX MA1 and an ESA Coulochem II amperometrical detector (room temperature; eluant: sodium hydroxide solution 480 mM; flow rate: 0.35 ml / min; detector sensitivity: 20 mA). Water and sorbitol contents were determined in all final samples and expressed as total weight (wt% ). The composition of the samples is indicated below as (sorbitol:water:starch). "
74,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,"['Results', 'Variations in thermomechanical properties']"," Fig. 1a and b shows variations of the E' modulus and tan δ as measured by DMTA on samples containing different sorbitol contents. The tan δ peak appearing at 100, 82 and 53 °C was associated with loss of the storage modulus E' whose onset was situated at 78, 59 and 29 °C, corresponding to the α relaxation for samples containing, respectively, 0% (0:13.5:86.5), 10% (10:9.9:80.1) and 25% (25:10.4:64.6) of sorbitol. The plasticising effect of sorbitol, (temperature decreasing of α relaxation associated with Tg), was clearly apparent. To show the modifications in low relaxation temperature more precisely, a part of Fig. 1 (between-120 and +20 °C) is shown in greater detail in Fig. 2. The sample without sorbitol showed at least two peaks at-86 and-65 °C attributed to local mobilities (Bradley and Carr, 1976, Nishinari and Fukada, 1980, Scandola et al., 1991). For a sample containing 10% sorbitol, a large peak probably composed of two relaxations was observed between-80 and-60 °C, and another intense peak appeared at-15 °C. For a sample containing 25% sorbitol, local mobilities of the polymer between-60 and-90 °C had almost totally disappeared, and a single very intense peak was observed, whose summit at-10 °C corresponded to the principal sorbitol relaxation. Each peak of tan δ (Fig. 2b) was associated with a decrease of storage modulus E' with temperature, whose curves are shown in Fig. 2a. As there was no relaxation for the sample containing 25% sorbitol between-120 and-10 °C, the storage modulus E' was greater than for samples containing 0 and 10% sorbitol in this temperature range. This behaviour was reversed above-10 °C because of the large decrease of E' due to the principal sorbitol relaxation for the sample containing 25% sorbitol. "

77,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,"['Results', 'Variation of oxygen permeability relative to sorbitol content']"," Films were conditioned at 57% relative humidity for 3 days before analysis (Table 1). Oxygen permeability dropped from 1.43×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for the sample without sorbitol (0:13.8:86.2) to 0.15×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for the sample containing less than 9% sorbitol (8.8:10.4:80.8). This value then increased slightly to 0.31×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for the film (21.0:9.0:70.0). Oxygen permeability increased, reaching 1.45×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for the film (24.3:10.3:65.3), i.e. a value close to that of the sample without sorbitol. The value obtained for the film (28.0:10.9:61.1) was slightly lower than the preceding one, but the standard deviation for this value was large. Nonetheless, this confirmed an increase as compared to the value obtained for the sample (21.0:9.0:70.0). The permeability values measured in this study were quite different from those obtained by Arvanitoyannis, Psomiadou and Nakayama (1996), which showed 0.37×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for 0% of sorbitol and around 10^-12 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for 28% of sorbitol. These discrepancies could be due to a different mode of sample preparation as well as to a difference in residual water content. However, the lowest value (0.15×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa) obtained for 8.8% of sorbitol was comparable to that of the EVOH (i.e. 0.12×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa at 0% ERH) (Salame, 1986) which is a material generally used as oxygen barrier. This property makes this type of starch based system of potential interest for limiting oxygen transfers. "

The water content of films at different ERH was determined from sorption curves obtained in a previous study. Due to rates and changes in oxygen permeability which depended strongly on the sorbitol content the curves in Fig. 3 are represented with two different scales. For the sample containing 28.0% sorbitol, an increase in permeability seems to be quasi-exponential with water content, reaching a value of 934.6×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for 29.0% of water. However, for the sample containing 8.8% sorbitol the increase in permeability relative to water content was fairly linear but moderate, reaching only 4.3×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa for 23.8% of water. For an equivalent water content, a permeability 50 times greater (more than 200×10^-16 cm^3 cm / cm^2 s Pa) was estimated for a sample containing 28.0% sorbitol. These values clearly show that the addition of a small quantity of sorbitol has a moderating effect on oxygen permeability despite large variations in equilibrium relative humidity. "

82,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,['Discussion']," Although studies of the thermomechanical properties of thin starch-based films (around 100 μm) have already been conducted (Gaudin et al., 1999, Lourdin et al., 1997b), measurements concerning thick films in 3-point bending mode allow better observation of variations of storage modulus E' with temperature. The increase of E' through addition of sorbitol to starch is indicative of an antiplasticising effect attributable to the disappearance of local starch mobility(ies). This effect is masked by the large variations in thermomechanical properties resulting from the glass transition of sorbitol beginning at approximately-10 °C. A high modulus can be expected with this type of material through the use of an additive whose glass transition temperature is higher than that of the material. Permeability, defined as the product of the coefficients of solubility and diffusion, involves a thermodynamic factor (solubility) and a kinetic factor affected by molecular mobilities (diffusion). Glassy polymers are characterised by low mobility and long relaxation times, whereas rubbery polymers show the opposite qualities (Stern, 1994). Diffusion is therefore totally different in these two states. Permeability depends especially on the available free volume for diffusion of gas molecules within the polymer. "
83,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,"['Discussion', 'Glassy state (ERH 0.57)']"," As demonstrated for mechanical properties (Gaudin et al., 1999), changes in oxygen permeability relative to sorbitol content showed a discontinuity at around 21% for an ERH to 0.57. Despite a decrease in glass transition from around 90-30 °C (Lourdin et al., 1997a), film permeability decreased about ten-fold between 0 and 21% of sorbitol. Stern (1994) noted that in glassy state local motions are involved in the diffusion of small molecules. In starch without added sorbitol, local mobilities revealed by low relaxation temperatures favoured oxygen diffusion, whereas the loss of these mobilities, attributable to the creation of bonds between starch and sorbitol, decreased oxygen permeability in the polymer. This phenomenon is comparable to that observed in antiplasticised synthetic polymer such as polycarbonate (Robeson, 1969), polysulphones (Maeda & Paul, 1987a), poly(phenylene oxide) (Maeda & Paul, 1987b) and more recently the starch / water system (Benczedi, 1999). Another relaxation or relaxations resulting mainly from the addition of sorbitol do(es) not favour oxygen diffusion. For sorbitol contents greater than 21% , Gaudin et al. (1999) showed that the mechanical plasticity of starch was not due to a rubbery state but the probable appearance of clusters of sorbitol, indicating that the matrix was still in the glassy state. Oxygen permeability, even though showing a reversal of tendency at 21% of sorbitol, did not increase abruptly, and the values obtained for high sorbitol contents were comparable to those for a sample without sorbitol. Therefore, the presence of clusters of sorbitol did not seem to favour permeability, probably because of the persistence of starch barrier properties highly interactive with a part of the sorbitol limiting oxygen diffusion. "
84,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,"['Discussion', 'Rubbery state (various ERH)']"," The minimum water contents required to obtain samples in rubbery state (Tg<20 °C) were evaluated on the basis of a previous study involving sorption measurements (Lourdin et al., 1997b). Water contents were approximately 19 and 15% , respectively, for 8.8 and 28.0% of sorbitol. For the sample containing 28.0% sorbitol, the marked increase in oxygen permeability with increasing water content was probably due to the transition from a glassy to a rubbery state. These results, corresponding to the behaviour generally observed in synthetic polymers, are attributable to high molecular mobility in the amorphous phase, which facilitates the diffusion of gas within the polymer. This state induces permeability linearly dependent on gas pressure (Rogers, 1985). However, this effect was not observed in the system containing 8.8% sorbitol. Contrary to expectations, the change between glassy and rubbery states did not seem very favourable to oxygen diffusion within the matrix. Strong interactions between starch and sorbitol persisted and were apparently dominant compared to the plasticising effect of water. This relative stability of permeability, despite variations in ambient humidity, is of potential interest in the context of applications requiring the persistence of good starch barrier properties. "
85,Antiplasticisation and oxygen permeability of starch–sorbitol films.xml,['Conclusion']," Sorbitol allows the oxygen permeability of starch films to be modified. In glassy state, decreased permeability results from the creation of links between sorbitol and starch, reducing the motions needed for oxygen diffusion. Although the nature of the motions involved in secondary relaxations is not completely clear, it would appear that changes in these secondary relaxations are responsible for the antiplasticisation affecting mechanical properties as well as oxygen permeability. The effect of water depends on the sorbitol content of the sample. It has often been observed that higher water content leads to increased permeability in hydrophilic biopolymer films. This effect, often explained by glass / rubber transition, was clearly present in films containing 28.0% sorbitol, but not in the sample containing 8.0% sorbitol. Although the nature of this effect is not entirely understood, it would seem of interest for potential applications of this type of material. "

"
88,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,['Introduction']," Food packaging is becoming increasingly important in the food industry, where advances in functionality such as convenience and portioning are gaining more attention. Furthermore, there is also an increased awareness on sustainability, which can in general be achieved on different levels. On the level of raw materials, use of recycled materials or use of renewable resources are two strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and the dependency on fossil resources. The production process is another level where adjustments, e.g. toward a more energy-efficient process, can be made. A final level where efforts can be done to increase sustainability is waste management. Next to reuse and recycling of used materials, production of packaging which is biodegradable and / or compostable contributes to reducing the municipal solid waste problem. Biodegradable polymers are polymers that are capable of undergoing decomposition into CO2, CH4, H2O, inorganic compounds or biomass through predominantly the enzymatic action of microorganisms. Some of these polymers can also be compostable, which means decomposition takes place in a compost site at a rate consistent with known compostable materials (Siracusa, Rocculi, Romani, & Dalla Rosa, 2008; Song, Murphy, Narayan, & Davies, 2009). In the last decade, there has been an increased interest from the food, packaging and distribution industry toward the development and application of bioplastics for food packaging. According to the European Bioplastics organization, bioplastics can be defined as plastics based on renewable resources (biobased) or as plastics which are biodegradable and / or compostable. Recently the attention in the packaging industry regarding the use of bioplastics has been shifting from compostable / biodegradable materials toward biobased materials (Molenveld, 2010). This article gives an overview of the main bioplastics, the most common limitations and possible solutions thereof and the current or possible use in food packaging. Furthermore, several characteristics of different biobased films were investigated with respect to their application in the food packaging area. Regarding the type of bioplastics described in this review, partly conventional materials such as polyethylene (PE) and polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) made from renewable resources are not discussed, as their properties do not differ from the crude oil based PE and PET. "
89,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Materials', 'PLA']"," PLA (polylactide) is a family of biodegradable thermoplastic polyester made from renewable resources which is nowadays seen as one of the most promising polymers for commercial use as a substitute for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS) and polyethyleneterephthalate (PET). It is produced by conversion of corn, or other carbohydrate sources, into dextrose, followed by a fermentation into lactic acid. Through direct polycondensation of lactic acid monomers or through ring-opening polymerization of lactide, PLA pellets are obtained. Since lactic acid exist as two optical isomers, l-and d-lactic acid, three different stereochemical compositions of lactide can be found, i.e. l,l-lactide, d,d-lactide and l,d-lactide. This stereochemical composition determines the final properties of the polymer. The processing possibilities of this transparent material are very wide, ranging from injection molding and extrusion over cast film extrusion to blow molding and thermoforming (Bogaert & Coszach, 2000; Drumright, Gruber, & Henton, 2000; Jamshidian, Tehrany, Imran, Jacquot, & Desobry, 2010; Joshi, 2008, Liu, 2006; Rasal, Janorkar, & Hirt, 2010; Siracusa et al., 2008; Södergard & Stolt, 2002). "
90,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Materials', 'Starch']"," Starch is a widely available and easy biodegradable natural resource. To produce a plastic-like starch-based film, high-water content or plasticizers (glycerol, sorbitol) are necessary. These plasticized materials (application of thermal and mechanical energy) are called thermoplastic starch (TPS) and constitute an alternative for polystyrene (PS). Starch-based thermoplastic materials (e.g. blends of TPS with synthetic / biodegradable polymer components, like polycaprolactone, polyethylene-vinyl alcohol or polyvinyl alcohol) have been successfully applied on industrial level for foaming, film blowing, injection molding, blow molding and extrusion applications (Bastioli, 1998; Chivrac, Pollet, & Avérous, 2009; Joshi, 2008, Mensitieri et al., 2011; Weber, 2000). "
91,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Materials', 'PHA']"," The polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) family are biodegradable thermoplastic polymers, produced by a wide range of microorganisms. The polymer is produced in the microbial cells through a fermentation process and then harvested by using solvents such as chloroform, methylene chloride or propylene chloride. More than 100 PHA composites are known, of which polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most common. The PHAs have potential as a substitute for many conventional polymers, since they possess similar chemical and physical properties (Cyras, Commisso, & Vázquez, 2009; Farinha, 2009; Lunt, 2009; Sanchez-Garcia, Gimenez, & Lagaron, 2008; Singh, 2011). "
92,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Materials', 'Cellulose']"," Cellulose is the most widely spread natural polymer and is derived by a delignification from wood pulp or cotton linters. It is a biodegradable polysaccharide which can be dissolved in a mixture of sodium hydroxide and carbon disulphide to obtain cellulose xanthate and then recast into an acid solution (sulfuric acid) to make a cellophane film. Alternatively, cellulose derivatives can be produced by derivatization of cellulose from the solvated state, via esterification or etherification of hydroxyl groups. Especially these cellulose derivatives were the subject of recent research. Cellulose esters like cellulose (di)acetate and cellulose (tri)acetate need addition of additives to produce thermoplastic materials. Most of them can be processed by injection molding or extrusion. Cellulose ethers like hydroxypropyl cellulose and methyl cellulose are water-soluble, except for ethyl cellulose and benzyl cellulose. Ethyl cellulose can be used for extrusion, laminating or molding after addition of plasticizers or other polymers. Most of these derivatives show excellent film-forming properties, but are too expensive for bulk use (Cyras et al., 2009; Liu, 2006; Petersen et al., 1999; Shen, Haufe, & Patel, 2009; Weber, 2000; Zepnik, Kesselring, Kopitzky, & Michels, 2010).

95,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,['Main limitations']," The use of bioplastics as food packaging materials is subjected to different limitations, restricting at this moment their use. Besides a higher price level compared to conventional plastics, the concerns on availability as well as on the use of land to produce bioplastics, there are major limitations on the functionality. Brittleness, thermal instability, low melt strength, difficult heat sealability, high water vapor and oxygen permeability restrict the use of PLA films for many food packaging applications (Cabedo, Feijoo, Villanueva, Lagarón, & Giménez, 2006; Jamshidian et al., 2010; Mensitieri et al., 2011; Rhim, Hong, & Ha, 2009). Because of the hydrophilic nature of starch and cellulose, packaging materials based on these materials have a low water vapor barrier, which causes a limited long-term stability and poor mechanical properties (sensitive to moisture content). Other drawbacks are bad processability, brittleness and vulnerability to degradation (Cyras et al., 2009; Gáspár, Benkó, Dogossy, Réczey, & Czigány, 2005; Joshi, 2008; Liu, 2006; Müller, Laurindo, & Yamashita, 2011; Shen et al., 2009; Yu, Dean, & Li, 2006). Brittleness (due to high glass transition and melting temperatures), stiffness, poor impact resistance and thermal instability are finally also factors limiting the application of PHA / PHB films as food packaging (Cyras et al., 2009; Liu, 2006; Modi, 2010; Yu et al., 2006). This has resulted in increasing research on improving the functionality of bioplastics, which is described in the next paragraph. "
96,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,['Improving the properties of bioplastics']," A large amount of studies have investigated different strategies to improve the properties of bioplastics. Specifically in terms of increasing barrier capacities toward gasses and water, following techniques, described in detail in subsequent paragraphs, could be used. "
97,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Improving the properties of bioplastics', 'Coating']"," In general, it can be stated that coating biobased films is a suitable tool to improve the properties of these films. Coating consists of applying an additional thin layer of another material on top of the biobased films. As illustrated by the examples below, especially the barrier properties, like oxygen and water vapor permeability and oil and grease resistance and to a lesser extent mechanical properties, like tensile strength and elasticity can be enhanced by applying such a coating. Different types of coating, biobased and non-biobased, can be used. The coating of PLA with PLA-Si / SiOx, PCL-Si / SiOx (polycaprolactone) or PEO-Si / SiOx (polyethylene oxide) enhanced the barrier (oxygen and water vapor) properties, which makes the PLA films applicable as a packaging material for medium shelf life products in combination with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) (sliced processed meat, fresh meat, cheeses, vegetables) (Iotti, Fabbri, Messori, Pilati, & Fava, 2009). Similarly, Hirvikorpi, Vähä-Nissi, Nikkola, Harlin, and Karppinen (2011) reported that a thin (25 nm) AlOx-coating can significantly improve the water vapor and oxygen barrier of several polymers (PLA-coated board, PLA film, nano-fibrillated cellulose film, PHB). PLA-coated paperboard (PLA: 35 g / m^2) coated with AlOx showed decreasing OTR values from 420 to 12 and 400 to 2 cm^3 / m^2 / 10^5 Pa / day for respectively 310 g / m^2 board and 210 g / m^2 board. The WVTR values decreased from 65 to 1 and 75 to 1 g / m^2 / day for respectively 310 g / m^2 board and 210 g / m^2 board. Coating of SPI films with PLA raised the tensile strength from 2.8 MPa up to 17.4 MPa and the elongation from 165.7% up to 203.4% . Water vapor permeability decreased 20-to 60-fold, depending on the PLA concentration in the coating solution (Rhim, Lee, & Perry, 2007). Coating of an acetylated cellulose film with PHB resulted in lower WVP values, higher elastic modulus and tensile strength for films containing 10% or more PHB and better strain at break for films containing 15% or more PHB (Cyras et al., 2009). A nitrocellulose or PVdC coating on cellophane improved both O2 and H2O barrier properties (Shen et al., 2009). In general, Popa and Belc (2007) stated that chitosan may be used as a biobased coating on polymers with poor gas barrier properties. "

These structures are called nanocomposites and could exhibit modifications in the properties of the materials or create novel properties and phenomena to the materials. To achieve these modifications, a good interaction between the polymer matrix (continuous phase) and the nanofiller (discontinuous phase) is desired (Lagaron & Lopez-Rubio, 2011). Incorporation of the filler into the polymer matrix can be achieved using in situ polymerization (dissolution of the nanoparticles in the monomer solution before polymerization), solvent intercalation (use of a solvent to enhance the affinity between the nanoparticles and the matrix) and melt intercalation (addition of the nanoparticles during extrusion) (Chivrac et al., 2009; Shen, Simon, & Cheng, 2002). Among the different nanoparticles which could be used to reinforce a biopolymer, nanoclays have attracted most attention. These nanoclays, like montmorillonite, belong to the family of phyllosilicates and have a structure based on the pyrophillite structure Si4Al2O10(OH)2. They are aggregates of stacked, ultrafine layered particles (tactoids). The thickness of one layer (or platelet) is in the order of 1 nm. Depending on the interaction between the continuous and the discontinuous phase, different polymer-clay interactions occur: tactoid, intercalated and exfoliated. When the affinity between the clay and the polymer is rather low, the clay interlayer does not expand and the clay tactoid structures remain as such in the polymer matrix. In this way, no true nanocomposite is formed. When the affinity between the clay and the polymer is moderate, medium expansion of the clay interlayer occurs. The polymer can partly penetrate the clay interlayer, leading to an intercalated structure, which is still a layered structure. When the affinity between the clay and the polymer is high, the layered structure of the clay is lost and an exfoliated structure is formed by dispersion of the clay into the polymer matrix (Arora & Padua, 2010; Chivrac et al., 2009). Since a high surface-to-volume ratio has the greatest effect on the properties of the polymer, the exfoliated structure is the ultimate goal. A good dispersion is affected by the hydrophobic / hydrophilic character of the polymer and the clay. Different chemical modification to make the surface of the nanoclay more hydrophobic, such as cationic exchange, use of ionomers, block copolymers adsorption and organosilane grafting, are sometimes necessary to improve intercalation / exfoliation into the polymer matrix. Also modification of the polymer and / or adding compatibilizing agents can lead to a more homogenous dispersion (Arora & Padua, 2010; Chivrac et al., 2009; Silvestre, Duraccio, & Cimmino, 2011). "
99,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Improving the properties of bioplastics', 'Blends', 'Nanotechnology', 'Effect of the use of nanoparticles on material properties']"," Incorporation of nanoparticles is an excellent way to improve the performance of biobased films. From the examples discussed below it can be concluded that almost all the shortcomings, which limit the use of biobased plastics as food packaging, can be overcome by making use of this technique. However, an important possible drawback is, at least partly, the reported negative effect on the elongation at break, especially in PLA films. The effect of the incorporation of nanoparticles, especially on the barrier properties, can be explained by the ‘confinement effect’. Polymer molecules can be ‘confined’ between the dispersed nanoparticles, providing a tortuous path, forcing the water and gas molecules to travel a longer path for diffusion through the film, thereby improving the barrier properties. The thermal stability can be explained by a slower diffusion of volatile decomposition products within the nanocomposite (Damme, 2008; Kumar, Sandeep, Alavi, & Truong, 2011; Nielsen, 1967; Silvestre et al., 2011). Properties of PLA / clay composite films can be improved by choosing the proper type of nanoclay and its optimum concentration (Rhim et al., 2009). Oxygen barrier properties of amorphous PLA increased by 50% by using chemically modified kaolinite. Addition of kaolinite nanofillers to PLA films is a feasible strategy to improve both thermal stability and mechanical properties (Bentz, 2011; Cabedo et al., 2006). Combination of PLA with montmorillonite-layered silicate ameliorated the barrier properties and made it applicable for food packaging (Arora & Padua, 2010). Strength and modulus of a PLA matrix increased by applying bentonite but it deteriorated the elongation (Petersson & Oksman, 2006). Sanchez-Garcia et al. (2010a) observed that addition of mica-based nanoclays to PLA caused a diminished UV transmittance. Adding zeolite type 4 particles enhanced the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity, but lowered the elongation at break. The changes occurred proportional to the zeolite loading (Yuzay, Auras, & Selke, 2009). Incorporation of organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT, Cloisite) into thermoplastic starch (TPS) raised the tensile strength with 28% , the elongation at break with 21% and reduced the water vapor permeability with 50% (Park, Lee, Park, Cho, & Ha, 2002). Avella et al. (2005) reported similar results. Addition of clay (montmorillonite) to TPS increased tensile strength, elongation at break and Young modulus at 15% relative humidity (RH), but only increased tensile strength and Young modulus at 60% RH. Mixing of this bionanocomposite with Ecoflex had a negative impact on the reinforcing effect of the clay, but heightened the elongation at break even more. Sanchez-Garcia and Lagaron (2010a) reported a lower water and oxygen permeability and a good UV-barrier of a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) film after incorporation of a mica-based clay. Reductions in water permeability of 61% , 76% and 47% were found for respectively 1 wt% , 5 wt% and 10 wt% of clay. A reduction in oxygen permeability of 32% was found for 5 wt% of clay. Raising the clay content did not result in further decrease of the oxygen permeability. PHBV films with 1, 3, 5 and 10 wt% of carbon nanofibers resulted in respectively 14, 5, 21 and 58% lower oxygen permeability, while 1, 5 and 10 wt% of nanotubes decreased the oxygen permeability with respectively 62, 10 and 33% (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2010b). Incorporation of chitosan nanoparticles in hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) resulted in better tensile strength (from 30.7 to 66.9 MPa) and barrier properties (De Moura, Avena-Bustillos, McHugh, Krochta, & Mattoso, 2008). Similarly, mixing of MMT (montmorillonite) with TPZ (thermoplastic zein) resulted in improved mechanical properties. Stress at break increased from 6.68 MPa to 13.98 MPa for respectively pure TPZ and TPZ + 10% MMT (Mensitieri et al., 2011). "
100,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Improving the properties of bioplastics', 'Blends', 'Nanotechnology', 'Migration and legal issues']"," Incorporation of nanoclays in biobased food packaging has a high potential, but before these new materials can be commercially used, the extent of migration of the nanoclays from the packaging material into the food has to be investigated. Up to now, only few studies on the migration of nanoclays from biobased packaging to food are present in literature. Avella et al. (2005) found very low migration of MMT from films of potato-starch and potato starch polyester blends into food simulants. Also Mauricio-Iglesias, Peyron, Guillard, and Gontard (2010) reported low migration of MMT from wheat gluten / MMT films into food simulants. Although these results are reassuring, the current knowledge on migration of nanoclays and their effect on the human health and environment is too limited and further research is necessary before these products can be put on the market for use as a food packaging material (Silvestre et al., 2011; Sorrentino, Gorrasi, & Vittoria, 2007). At present, no specific regulation for nanoparticles is established, meaning that Regulation (EC) 1935 / 2004 is still applicable for nanomaterials. In 2009, EFSA concluded its assessment of the potential risks of nanotechnologies for food and feed, stating that a cautious, case-by-case approach is needed as many uncertainties remain over its safe use (Silvestre et al., 2011; Sorrentino et al., 2007). "
101,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Improving the properties of bioplastics', 'Blends', 'Cellulose']"," Another way to improve the properties of biobased films is the addition of the biopolymer cellulose. The most pronounced effect of this embodiment was the reduced water vapor permeability, but also several mechanical properties, like tensile strength and Young's modulus were influenced. Also here, the crucial point seems to be the elongation at break. Dias, Müller, Larotonda, and Laurindo (2011) and Müller, Laurindo, and Yamashita (2009) observed that the incorporated cellulose fibers were well cemented in the plasticized starch polymer matrix. This is because the chemical similarity between starch and natural fibers provides a strong interaction (Avérous, Fringant, & Moro, 2001; Lu, Weng, & Cao, 2006). The positive effect of the incorporation of cellulose fibers on the water permeability of (starch-based) films is related to the highly crystalline and hydrophobic character of the fibers. As for the nanoclays, addition of cellulose fibers decreases the water vapor transmission by increasing the diffusion path length through the film (tortuous path). However, this effect can be reversed by adding too much fibers, causing congregation (Kristo & Biliaderis, 2007; Müller et al., 2009). Addition of cellulose fibers to starch-based films (made of rice flour) diminished the water vapor permeability with 35% (plasticized with glycerol) or 14% (plasticized with sorbitol) and increased the tensile strength and Young's modulus, without altering the elongation at break (Dias et al., 2011). Müller et al. (2009) also found reinforcement of starch films and lower water vapor permeability after incorporation of cellulose fibers. Also, application of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in starch-based films showed a decrease of the water vapor permeability with increasing CMC content (Ghanbarzadeh, Almasi, & Entezami, 2011). Addition of 5 wt% ZnO-CMC to plasticized pea starch improved tensile strength (from 3.9 to 9.8 MPa) and water vapor permeability, but reduced the elongation at break (from 42.2 to 25.8% ) (Yu, Yang, Liu, & Ma, 2009). Gáspár et al. (2005) tested the effect of different natural additives (cellulose, hemicellulose, zein and poly-ε-caprolactone) on the water resistance of a starch-based film (70% corn starch + 30% glycerol). Hemicellulose and zein filled starch-based film showed better tensile strength and modulus than the pure film, but elongation of all four filled films was lower than the pure TPS (thermoplastic starch). Water resistance of cellulose, hemicellulose, zein and polycaprolactone filled films was better compared to pure TPS, but the zein filled film showed the lowest water uptake after 14 days. Sanchez-Garcia et al. (2008) investigated the effect of cellulose fibers in PHBV films. Water permeability decreased with 52% for 10 wt% fiber content and with 71% for 1 wt% fiber content. Alternatively, Cyras, Commisso, Mauri, and Vázquez (2007) investigated the influence of PHB on cellulose paper and found that addition of PHB with more than 10 wt% had a positive influence on water vapor permeability (WVP) and on the mechanical strength of the cellulose paper. According to Petersson and Oksman (2006) incorporation of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) showed no reduction in the oxygen permeability of PLA. In contrast, Sanchez-Garcia and Lagaron (2010b) found up to 90% oxygen permeability reduction for PLA after addition of 1, 2, 3, or 5 wt% cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW). "
102,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Improving the properties of bioplastics', 'Blends', 'Others']"," Various other materials can be used to improve the properties of a biobased material. Several of them are described in the following paragraphs. Among them, especially blends of two biobased materials seems to have a great potential. When blending materials, compatibility is a major challenge. Enhancing this compatibility for immiscible polymers can be done by the introduction of a reactive functional group, chemical modification (e.g. of the hydroxyl groups of starch with a hydrophobic compound) or esterification (Thiebaud et al., 1997). Although most of the blended polymers seemed immiscible and / or incompatible (see next paragraph), positive effects of blending were observed. Although PLA and PCL were clearly immiscible, Cabedo et al. (2006) observed no extensive voiding and debonding at the interphase, suggesting some sort of compatibility. Suyatma, Copinet, Tighzert, and Coma (2004) found that chitosan and PLA were immiscible and incompatible, due to the absence of specific interaction between both polymers. This incompatibility leads to decreased mechanical properties when blending those two polymers. A blend of PHB / PLA prepared by casting after dissolution in chloroform (3% w / v), evaporation at room temperature and vacuum drying for 24 h, suggested immiscibility of both polymers in the amorphous state. Melt blending, evaporation under reduced pressure and maintaining the blend at 190 °C for 30 min implied greater miscibility. A possible explanation is that transesterification between PHB and PLA chains at 190 °C leads to the production of block copolymers. These polymers will act to compatibilize both polymers and improve their miscibility (Zhang, Xiong, & Deng, 1996). Furthermore, also PHB and HV and PHBV and PLA seemed to be mostly immiscible, although some interactions between the polymers were observed. Higher PLA concentrations lead to more compatibility, but render the material more difficult to process (Modi, 2010). In contrast with the above, starch and PHB have been reported to be significantly compatible (Koller & Owen, 1996). Blending PLA with PCL (polycaprolactone) reduces the brittleness and slightly increases the thermal stability of the PLA film, but decreases the barrier properties proportional to the amount of PCL added. Loss of barrier properties can be reversed by adding kaolinite nanoclays. Combination of PLA with starch, plasticizers (glycerol / sorbitol) or other degradable polyesters can diminish the brittleness of the film (Cabedo et al., 2006). Addition of PLA to a chitosan film had a positive effect on water vapor permeability and sensitivity to moisture, but decreased the tensile strength and elasticity modulus (Suyatma et al., 2004). Incorporation of 3-hydroxyvalerate (HV) in PHB, resulting in PHBV, increased the impact strength, elongation at break, tensile strength and decreased the Young's modulus, making the film tougher and more flexible, with increasing HV content (Modi, 2010; Shen et al., 2009). Blending PHBV with PLA had a positive effect on elasticity modulus, elongation at break, flexural strength for many different blends, but tensile strength did not improve in any of them. Similarly, Zhang et al. (1996) reported improved mechanical properties for PHB / PLA blends compared with ordinary PHB. Further, PVA (polyvinylacetate) grafted on PIP (poly-cis-1,4-isoprene) and blended with PHB showed better tensile properties and impact strength than PHB / PIP blends, which were immiscible (Modi, 2010; Yoon et al., 1999). Thermoplastic starch (TPS) blended with PHA had a positive effect on barrier properties and hydrolytic and UV stability of the starch-based film and diminished processing temperature resulting in less starch degradation (Shen et al., 2009). Blends of TPS with natural rubber appeared to be less brittle than TPS alone (Yu et al., 2006). Addition of locust bean gum (LBG) improved the tensile strength, but lowered the elongation of starch-based films. However, elongation significantly improved after gamma irradiation. Also the WVP improved with increasing irradiation dose (Kim, Jo, Park, & Byun, 2008). Blending agar with starch had a positive effect on the microstructure of the starch film. WVP and mechanical properties were enhanced (Wu, Geng, Chang, Yu, & Ma, 2009). Famá, Gerschenson, and Goyanes (2009) stated that blending starch with wheat bran reduced the WVP of the film and improved the mechanical properties with increasing wheat bran fiber content. "
103,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Improving the properties of bioplastics', 'Chemical/physical modification']"," Another way to improve the performance of bioplastics is by chemical and / or physical modification. Modification can have a positive effect on mechanical properties and water vapor permeability of materials as such, but modification can also be a tool to enhance compatibility between two polymers. For the latter, mostly starch has been modified to improve their hydrophobicity, making them more compatible with hydrophobic materials. WVP of starch films decreased after addition of citric acid. A 10% (w / w) citric acid content showed the greatest reduction. This can be explained by the multi carboxyl structure of citric acid. These groups can interact with the hydroxyl groups of the starch, which results in a reduction of available OH groups. Furthermore, strong hydrogen bounds can be formed, preventing retrogradation and recrystallization. Mechanical properties can also be improved, because citric acid can serve as a cross-linking agent (Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2008, Thiebaud et al., 1997). Oxygen permeability and hydrophobicity of microfibrillar cellulose (MFC) films can be improved by acetylation with acetic anhydride. Film thicknesses between 42 and 47 μm lead to oxygen permeability values required for modified atmosphere packaging application (Rodionova, Lenes, Eriksen, & Gregersen, 2011). Flexible and water resistant starch films can be made by heating gelatinized starch in an anhydrous suspension with lithium chloride in the presence of an organic solvent (Fang et al., 2005). Chemical modification by cross-linking cellulose acetate with tri-sodium tri-meta phosphate led to materials with improved mechanical properties (higher tensile strength), lower water up take and slower degradation kinetics. This can be explained by the cross-linking of some of the hydroxyl groups that were present in the cellulose acetate blend (Demirgöz et al., 2000). Incorporation of starch modified by epichlorohydrin in comparison with native starch in an LLDPE film resulted in higher tensile strength and elongation. Crosslinked starch is more hydrophobic because it has more carbon chains than native starch. This causes better compatibility of the starch with the LLDPE film (Kim & Lee, 2002). Yin, Li, Liu, and Li (2005) found that boric acid serves as an excellent cross-linking agent for starch with poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA). A film with good water resistance and mechanical properties could be made. According to Gennadios, Weller, and Testin (1993) the water vapor and oxygen barrier properties of a wheat gluten derived film can be improved by partial substitution of the wheat gluten with hydrolyzed keratin, probably due to linkages between the two proteins. A better water vapor barrier was also obtained by soaking a wheat gluten film in CaCl2 and then in distilled water or by soaking it in a solution at a pH of 7.5. These processes also provided higher tensile strength and are probably caused by respectively cross-linking of Ca^2+ in the film structure and by protein insolubility at a pH equal to the isoelectric point of wheat gluten. According to Rhim, Gennadios, Fu, Curtis, and Milford (1999) UV irradiation of a wheat gluten based film increased the tensile strength by 20% , suggesting cross-linking within the film structure. However, the cross-linking seemed insufficient for an effect on the WVP. "
104,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,['Possible application']," Several studies have investigated the possible use of biobased material for food packaging, especially in comparison with traditional packaging materials. At present it appears that mainly for fresh (respiring) produce, like fruits and vegetables, fresh meat and fresh juices various biobased options are available, but also fat rich products could be packed in biobased packaging. For these products, biobased packaging can even have a positive effect on the food product in comparison to the conventional packaging. It can be concluded that at present the main focus for biobased packaging are short shelf life applications and dry products that do not require high oxygen and / or water vapor barrier. "
105,Application of bioplastics for food packaging.xml,"['Possible application', 'PLA']"," Several studies on PLA based packaging have shown that they could replace some of the conventional packaging for a number of food products. Koide and Shi (2007) evaluated the microbiological and physicochemical quality of whole green peppers packed in a PLA based film (Tohcello, 25 μm, Japan) compared to LDPE and perforated LDPE. Results showed no significant difference in hardness, ascorbic acid concentration and color after 1 week of storage at 10 °C, but for the PLA film coliform bacteria counts were lower. Fresh cut romaine lettuce can be packed in thermoformed oriented PLA (OPLA) during storage at 10 °C (Benyathiar et al., 2009). Almenar et al., 2008, Almenar et al., 2010 stated that PLA containers (Versapack^®, 8 oz., Wilkinson Industries Inc., USA) are possibly applicable for commercial post harvest packaging of blueberries. In contrast to the conventional PET container, an equilibrium modified atmosphere could be developed inside the PLA containers. This increased the shelf life of the blueberries. Sensory evaluations showed that consumers preferred blueberries packed in PLA containers for one or two weeks over the blueberries packed in conventional containers. Haugaard, Weber, Danielsen, and Bertelsen (2002) reported that PLA packaging (thermoformed cups, Autobar, France) is suitable for storage of fresh, unpasteurized orange juice at 4 °C for 14 days. Color changes, ascorbic acid (AA) degradation and limonene scalping were most effectively prevented by PLA when compared to PS and HDPE. "

Furthermore, Ifezue (2009) found Mater-Bi^® (blend of starch with biodegradable synthetic polymers like PCL or PVOH) to be superior to perforated LDPE, PLA and Ecoflex to pack whole fresh celery, especially regarding mechanical performance. Also Kantola and Helen (2001) stated that the quality of tomatoes packed in PLA-coated cardboard covered with a perforated Mater-Bi^® bag remained as good as when packed in LDPE (low-density polyethylene) bags during 3 weeks.

Levkane, Muizniece-Brasava, and Dukalska (2008) investigated the effect of pasteurization on a meat salad packed in conventional (PE, PP) and biobased packaging (PLA, PHB) and found that PHB films could be successfully used to pack this type of food. Haugaard, Danielsen, and Bertelsen (2003) found that orange juice simulant and dressing packed in PHB resulted in the same quality changes compared to HDPE, which means commercial juices and other acidic beverages and dressings or other fatty foods could possibly be packed in PHB. Furthermore, Bucci, Tavares, and Sell (2005) stated that PP can be replaced by PHB for packaging of fat rich products (mayonnaise, margarine and cream cheese) according to physical, mechanical (dynamic compression and impact resistance), sensorial and dimensional (dimensions, volumetric capacity, weight and thickness) tests.

Also a lot of cellulose derivatives are produced commercially, of which cellulose acetate (CA) is the most commonly used for food packaging (fresh produce, baked goods). Makino and Hirata (1997) showed that a laminate of chitosan-cellulose and PCL had a similar film permeability as LDPE, which makes this laminate a possible MAP packaging for fresh produce (shredded lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, sweet corn and broccoli). Usability was confirmed by computer simulation. Popa and Belc (2007) found that coating of cellophane with nitrocellulose or PVdC (polyvinylidine chloride) improved barrier properties and this film could be used for packaging of candies, processed meat, cheese and baked goods.

Several physical and mechanical properties (e.g. gas and water vapor permeability) and some other characteristics (e.g. amount biobased) were examined or provided by the companies. This table shows that the investigated materials cover a broad range for the different physical and mechanical characteristics that were examined. Considering gas and water vapor permeabilities, it can be stated that the materials are ranging from low barrier to high barrier films. Considering the tensile properties, elastic and less elastic films and films with high and low strength can be found in the table. This means that these films could be used for a wide range of packaging applications. Concerning the other characteristics, not all of them were tested for every film, since several films are still in the test phase. All of the films that were already tested are printable. All the tested films can be used for refrigerated storage, except for Natureflex™ N913 and Xylophane A and B and for frozen storage, except for Xylophane A and B. For applications where pasteurization is needed, none of the tested films can be used. Most of the films are already food approved (according to regulation 1935 / 2004). All the films are at least 40% biobased and derived from non-food raw materials or corn. Considering the variation in film characteristics displayed in Table 3, it can be stated that multilayered biobased films have properties which make them applicable for use as a packaging material for various types of foods, ranging from short shelf life products, over medium shelf life to long shelf life products.

Storage tests and tests on the industrial packaging machines should be performed to make sure that these films can be used commercially. It can be concluded that biobased materials offer great potential for the packaging industry. It is however important to realize that a thorough evaluation of the functional properties of a biobased material is essential before it can be used as an alternative for traditional film materials.

122,Barrier and mechanical properties of carrot puree films.xml,['Introduction']," Edible films, serving as selective barriers to moisture transfer, oxygen uptake, lipid oxidation, and losses of volatile aromas and flavors, can improve food quality and shelf life (Donhowe and Fennema, 1993, Krochta and De Mulder-Johnston, 1997, Krochta, 1997). Their use is gaining important attention in food protection and preservation because of their advantages, such as (1) lowering the cost and reduction of the environmental pollution; (2) improvement of organoleptical characteristics and textural properties of foods; (3) possibility of enrobing particular portions or layers of heterogeneous foods; (4) preservation of flavor components and shelf life extension (Guilbert, 1986, Tharanathan, 2003, Weber et al., 2002). Potential properties and applications of edible films have been extensively reviewed (Bravin et al., 2006, Jagannath et al., 2006, Min et al., 2005, Serrano et al., 2006). Components of edible films include proteins, cellulose derivatives, alginates, pectins, starches, waxes, composites and other materials (Tharanathan, 2003). In recent years, the development of fruit and vegetable purees films has been investigated. Fruit and vegetable purees (such as peach, strawberry, apple, tomato and broccoli) have been used to form edible films (McHugh and Olsen, 2004, Sothornvit and Pitak, 2007). These films showed certain moisture, carbon dioxide, oxygen, lipid, flavor barriers and mechanical properties, which translated on sufficient strength to protect food and extend shelf life (McHugh and Senesi, 2000, McHugh and Olsen, 2004). Therefore, increasing research interest is focused on edible films made from fruit and vegetable purees. Carrot is a very important vegetable because of its nutritious value, however, a few of carrot products are developed. Therefore, searching an alternative product to add value to carrot is significantly required. Since carrot mainly consists of water, protein, cellulosic substances and pectic (Bao and Chang, 1994), these compounds might provide sufficient properties to form renewable, biodegradable and inexpensive films and packages. Obtaining films with good oxygen permeability (OP) and desirable film mechanical properties would be an indication of the possible use of carrot as an alternative source of packaging. Carrot films may have a potential to be commercial because they can be used as food or food packaging. In previous studies, we found that adding one kind of hydrocolloid could not solve the problem of poor mechanical strength of carrot films. In this study, we added CMC, corn starch and gelatin which may produce synergistic effect to improve the strength of carrot films. CMC is a cellulose derivative that is mainly used in food for its viscosity, water binding properties, and solution clarity. CMC is anionic that possess unique functional properties, such as thermal gelation and superior clarity (Marceliano, 2009). The use of corn starch for producing edible films has a long history (Kester and Fennema, 1986). Generally, such films have the advantage of lower cost compared to other alternative high tensile strength materials. Gelatin obtained by partial degradation of collagen has gained more attention as edible films for its abundance, good gelling properties, and biodegradability (Cao et al., 2007, Dangaran et al., 2009). The properties of the films are affected by the intrinsic properties of the film components (crystallinity, hydrophobicity / hydrophilicity, surface charge, pI, molecular size, and three-dimensional shape) and extrinsic processing factors (processing temperature, drying conditions, pH, ionic strength, salt-type, relative humidity during processing and storage, shear and pressure) (Dangaran et al., 2009). Generally, films made from polysaccharides, such as starches, gelatin and cellulose derivatives, are expected to be excellent oxygen barriers due to their tightly packed, and ordered hydrogen-bonded network structure, and have high tensile strength. However, films are too brittle for application (García et al., 2009). An usual approach to improve mechanical properties of edible films is to add a plasticizer (a low molecular weight nonvolatile substance) into the film to reduce biopolymer chain-to-chain interaction, resulting in the improvement of film flexibility and stretch ability. Glycerol is found to be the best plasticizer for water soluble polymers (Jangchud and Chinnan, 1999). Based on this finding, glycerol was used as plasticizer. The major objectives of this study were (a) to prepare a new blend composite edible film with carrot puree, CMC, corn starch and gelatin, and (b) to evaluate the effects of CMC, corn starch, gelatin and glycerol contents on its mechanical and barrier properties.

But when the content of glycerol was more than 5% (w / w), which is the maximum amount of glycerol plasticizers (García et al., 2009), the plasticizer would migrate to the film surface and lead to sticky films. "
134,Barrier and mechanical properties of carrot puree films.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Mechanical properties']"," Tensile strength and elongation are parameters that relate mechanical properties of films to their chemical structures (McHugh and Krochta, 1994). Tensile strength expresses the maximum stress developed in a film during tensile testing (Gennadios et al., 1994). Elongation at the break is a measure of the stretch ability of the film prior to breakage (Krochta and De Mulder-Johnston, 1997). Adding CMC, corn starch and gelatin to films largely increased tensile strength, and corn starch contents showed significant effect (p ≤ 0.05) as shown in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4. The addition of CMC, corn starch and gelatin to films increased% E, but decreased it at high contents. Similar results were found in gelatin-starch films (Arvanitoyannis et al., 1997). Increasing CMC, corn starch and gelatin helped improve film strength probably due to the high polysaccharide and protein contents, which helped form the film network structure. Polysaccharides can form cross-link with protein and improve the strength of films. Moreover, the polysaccharide and protein can provide additional hydrogen bonding interactions between polymer chains resulting in the film strength (McHugh and Olsen, 2004).% E decreased at high contents of CMC, corn starch and gelatin might due to the addition of too much CMC, corn starch or gelatin lowered the flexibility of the films (Xu et al., 2005). Adding a plasticizer to edible films is required to overcome film brittleness caused by extensive intermolecular forces. Plasticizers reduce these forces, thereby improving flexibility and extensibility of the films (Forssell et al., 2002). In other words, plasticizers extend, dilute and soften the structure effectively, thereby increasing the chain mobility (Guilbert, 1986). As expected, TS decreased, but% E increased as glycerol content increased (Table 5). Glycerol as a plasticizer reduced interactions between polymer chains, thereby reducing film strength and increasing film flexibility (Sothornvit and Krochta, 2000, Sothornvit and Krochta, 2001). Thus, adding of glycerol to carrot puree film increased its extensibility and reduced its mechanical strength. Similar results were reported by Park et al. (1993) for cellulose-based films and Gontard et al. (1993) for wheat gluten films. "

139,Barrier and mechanical properties of carrot puree films.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Water vapor permeability']"," A main function of edible film is to impede moisture transfer between the surrounding atmosphere and food, or between two components of a heterogeneous food product, so the water vapor permeability is as low as possible. The WVP of edible films depends on many factors, such as the integrity of the film, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic ratio, the ratio between crystalline and amorphous zones, and the polymeric chain mobility (Mei and Zhao, 2003). The WVP of films with different contents of CMC, corn starch and gelatin were shown as Table 2, Table 3, Table 4. When the content of gelatin was fixed, the WVP of the films moderately increased with increasing CMC and corn starch contents. This result may be attributed to that CMC and corn starch were more hydrophilic materials (Jia et al., 2009). However, when the contents of CMC and corn starch were fixed, the WVP first decreased as gelatin content increased from 0% to 0.3% (w / w) and then increased with increasing gelatin content from 0.3% to 0.5% (w / w). This phenomenon could be related to the significant hydrogen bonding interaction with water, favoring water vapour transmission through the films (Zhong and Xia, 2008). Unplasticized matrices were often brittle and rigid once dried, due to strong interactions between polymer chains that favor crystal development. A plasticizer can remedy this problem, since it can improve films flexibility by reducing interactions between polymer chains. The effect of glycerol content on the WVP of the films was shown in Table 5. The WVP of the films increased with increasing glycerol content in the range of glycerol content studied. It was shown that glycerol favored WVP due to its hydrophilic nature and increased water diffusion rate within the film by allowing greater polymer chain mobility. Similar results were reported in previous works (Yang and Paulson, 2000, Bertuzzi et al., 2007). Generally, water vapor transmission through a hydrophilic film depends on both diffusivity and solubility of water molecules in the film matrix (Gontard and Guilbert, 1994). An increase in the inter chain spacing due to inclusion of glycerol molecules between the polymer chains may promote water vapor diffusivity through the film and hence accelerate the water vapor transmission. The high hydrophilicity of glycerol molecules which was favorable to the adsorption of water molecules could also contribute to the increase in the film WVP (Gontard et al., 1993). Additionally, at high glycerol content, glycerol could cluster with itself to open the polymer structure, enhancing the water vapor permeability of the film (Lieberman and Gilbert, 1973). Hernandez (1994) indicated that water vapor transfer generally occurs through the hydrophilic portion of the film and depends on the hydrophilic-hydrophobic ratio of the film components. Compared with other edible films (Table 6), carrot puree films are intermediate moisture barriers at similar test condition (23 °C and 83±1% RH). This result indicates the potential of carrot puree films can be used as edible packaging for dried foods. "

141,Barrier and mechanical properties of carrot puree films.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Oxygen permeability']"," Oxygen is the key factor that might cause oxidation, which initiates several food changes such as odor, color, flavor and nutrients deterioration. Obtaining films with adequate oxygen barrier can help improve food quality and extending food shelf life (Sothornvit and Pitak, 2007). Generally, hydrophilic biopolymer films have shown good oxygen barrier property. As can be observed in Table 3, there was an improvement of O2 barrier properties of the films with corn starch below 3% . When the content of corn starch increased above 3% , the blended films showed higher OP. CMC and gelatin improved the barrier properties of the blended films. The permeability of the blended films to oxygen and carbon dioxide decreased with the increases of CMC and gelatin (Table 2, Table 4). The OP value strongly depends on the interaction between the polymer matrix and O2 (García et al., 2000). The improvement of O2 barrier properties of the blended films increased with the increase of corn starch, CMC and gelatin probably due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between CMC and gelatin backbone and OH^-of corn starch (Zhong and Xia, 2008). The increased molecular interaction resulted in a film with compact structure and low OP. The OP value increased with the increase of corn starch from 3% because corn starch intramolecular hydrogen bonds rather than intermolecular hydrogen bonds were formed. This resulted in a phase separation among the main components where the film could not be formed well, facilitating the O2 permeation (Zhong and Xia, 2008). Table 5 shows that increasing glycerol content did not significantly increase the oxygen permeability of films (p > 0.05). The good oxygen barrier of films was not modified. The slight increase in oxygen permeability occurred most likely because of increase in polymer chain mobility, which was caused by glycerol and facilitated the transport process. It is likely that an increase of biopolymer chain mobility and creation of void spaces in the film matrix were responsible for the increase in the oxygen permeability (García et al., 2000). Carrot puree films are good oxygen barriers, exhibiting values of 14.57±0.18 to 20.27±0.07 cm^3 / m s Pa. Compared with other edible films (Table 7), carrot puree films are excellent oxygen barriers at similar test condition (50% RH and 25±2 °C). This result indicates the potential of carrot puree films to be used as a natural packaging to protect food from oxidation reactions. Therefore, appropriate uses of the carrot puree films could be for some foods that are susceptible to oxidation, such as confectionery products, baked foods, nuts and others (McHugh et al., 1996). In addition, the carrot puree films might retard respiration rates of the fruits and vegetables and extend their shelf life similar to the studies of apple wraps for the fresh-cut apples (McHugh and Senesi, 2000).

A positive b value is a measure of yellowness, and a negative value of blueness. As can be seen, the L, a and b decreased with the increase of the corn starch (Table 3), similar to the results reported by Bourtoom and Chinnan (2008). Moreover, the L, a and b values of carrot films increased with the increase of glycerol (Table 5). Similar results were reported by García et al. (2004) and Chillo et al. (2008). Rhim et al. (2000) reported that the addition of various compounds that structurally bind with the film forming solutions probably changed the native color of the films. It was also observed (Table 2, Table 4) that the increases of CMC and gelatin did not change the L, a and b significantly (p > 0.05). The results agree with those of Chillo et al. (2008). "
144,Barrier and mechanical properties of carrot puree films.xml,['Conclusions']," The carrot puree film strength increased with increasing CMC, corn starch and gelatin contents, while the film flexibility increased with increasing glycerol content. Increasing glycerol content increased the film OP and WVP, but the good oxygen barrier was not significantly modified. Moreover, the carrot puree films presented intermediate WVP compared with other edible films. Increasing glycerol content determined an increase in L, a and b values. Instead, increasing corn starch content produced an decrease of L, a and b values. These results suggest that carrot puree films could be suitable as edible packaging for some foods or applied as a wrap on food products to provide nutrition and convenient use for consumers reducing food packaging waste.

In addition, barrier properties against grease and water were measured. The results showed that an oxygen permeability in the same range as that of poly(ethylene terephthalate) was obtained at coat weights exceeding 5 g / m^2. The oxygen permeability was not substantially affected by temperature changes, provided that the air permeance of the base paper was low. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen permeabilities were low enough to be measurable only at a coat weight exceeding 5 g / m^2 and only on the two base papers with the lowest air permeance. The mechanical properties were characterized by tensile strength and fracture strain. The tensile strength was not affected by the coat weight, whereas the fracture strain was highest for coat weights exceeding 5 g / m^2. High grease resistance values were also obtained at this coat weight, whereas the water resistance deteriorated slightly due to the hygroscopic character of the chitosan. However, a coat weight as high as 5 g / m^2 could only be achieved on a bench scale. On a pilot scale, the maximum coat weight was 0.2 g / m^2 because the solids content of the coating solution used was limited to 1.0 wt% due to the high molecular weight of the chitosan used and the resultant high viscosity of the polymer solution. The coating on a pilot scale was performed using the metered size press technique. "

151,Barrier and surface properties of chitosan-coated greaseproof paper.xml,['Introduction']," A low gas permeability is a crucial requirement for many food packaging materials and a low oxygen transmission rate is one of the main requirements (Paine & Paine, 1992). Other important gases to which food packaging should be impermeable are carbon dioxide and nitrogen. To meet this demand, paper-based packaging materials are laminated with aluminium or extrusion-coated with synthetic oxygen-barrier polymers. However, the lamination and extrusion processes are performed off-line and they are therefore less cost-effective than in-line processes. Barrier coatings based on chitosan offer benefits because these polymers can be applied to the paper in-line as an aqueous solution using conventional coating techniques. In addition, the use of recoverable oxygen-barrier coatings instead of laminates with aluminium or synthetic polymers may yield environmental benefits (Lang, 1995). Chitosan is a polymer based on a renewable material, which exhibits excellent oxygen-barrier properties due to its high crystallinity and the hydrogen bonds between the molecular chains (Gällstedt, 2001, Kittur et al., 1998). Moreover, it exhibits a good barrier against grease (Kittur et al., 1998) and good antibacterial and fungicidal properties (Luyen and Rossbach, 1992, Outtara et al., 2000, Shahidi et al., 1999). Chitosan also possesses good mechanical properties, as has been shown in the work of Arvanitoyannis, Kalichevsky, Blanshard, and Psomiadou (1994) and Arvanitoyannis, Nakayama, and Aiba (1998). These researchers studied the mechanical properties of films composed of chitosan / gelatine and chitosan / poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and found that the tensile strength was increased when the fraction of chitosan in the film was increased. Chitosan has also been tested as a wet end additive in paper board and the mechanical properties of the product were reported to be improved (Laleg & Pikulik, 1991). The chitosan retention was also reported to be good, due to the different charges of the chitosan and cellulose, the former being cationic and the latter being anionic. This charge difference can also be expected to yield good adhesion between a chitosan coating and a cellulose-based substrate. These properties make chitosan an attractive polymer for the barrier coating of cellulose-based materials for food packaging purposes. Chitosan definitely has a promising potential, but many questions and problems still have to be solved before it can be commercially used as a replacement for aluminium and synthetic polymers. These questions concern the demands on the chitosan coating and the cellulose substrate as well as on the coating process. One of the most frequently used processes for applying an aqueous coating to a paper substrate is the Metering Sized Press (MSP) (Klass, 2002), which consists of two rolls (transfer rolls), on each side of the paper, in contact with each other onto which a pre-metered amount of the coating is dosed, usually with a smooth or wire-wounded rod. The coating is transferred to the paper in the nip between the two transfer rolls, and the two sides of the paper can be simultaneously coated. With a starch solution at 5-18% solids, a dry coat weight of 0.7-4.0 g / m^2 can be obtained (Klass, 2002). A higher coat weight can be obtained using curtain coating (Schweizer, 2002) which is a coating technique in which the paper industry has begun to show a considerable interest. In this study, greaseproof papers with different air permeances (AP) were coated with chitosan on both a bench scale and a pilot scale to study the conditions required to obtain a packaging material with a good gas barrier. Greaseproof paper was chosen as a substrate for the coating because it is a dense and well-bonded paper on which the coating can be expected to form a homogeneous surface. Base paper structure is of great importance for the homogeneity and the barrier properties of the applied coating (Schuman, Wikström, & Rigdahl, 2004). The results showed that a good oxygen-barrier as well as good grease resistance was achieved at coat weights exceeding 5 g / m^2. However, the nitrogen and carbon dioxide barrier properties seemed to be affected by the pore structure of the base paper even at such high coat weights. The water resistance was, however, slightly lower at a coat weight of 5 g / m^2. Coat weights of 5 g / m^2 could only be achieved on a bench scale. On a pilot scale, the maximum achievable coat weight was considerably less. "

The chemical structure of chitosan is shown in Fig. 1. Glacial acetic acid puriss 98% from Labassco AB, Partille, Sweden, was used in the bench-scale trials to protonize the chitosan amine group and make the chitosan soluble in water. In the trial on a pilot scale, glacial acetic acid of a 98% technical grade from Univar AB, Malmö, Sweden, was used. The chitosan solution used in the bench-scale trials was prepared by dissolving 3.0 g of chitosan in 250 g water and 3.0 g acetic acid. The solution was mixed for 1 h before use. The chitosan solution used in the pilot trials was prepared by dissolving 1.5 kg of chitosan in 150 kg water and 1.5 kg acetic acid under continuous stirring. The viscosity of the solution was measured using a conventional controlled-shear-stress rheometer, Paar Physica, MCR 300, Graz, Austria. Viscosity measurements were performed with a concentric cylinder geometry at 25 °C. The viscosity of the prepared chitosan solution was 449 mPa s at a shear rate of 129 s^-1. "

The dryer section of the pilot coater consisted of one infrared dryer and three air-dryers. The properties of the coated papers were investigated without any calendering. The papers were stored at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity (RH) for 3-20 days before testing. Free chitosan films were prepared for the determination of the glass transition temperature (Tg) by casting chitosan solution into petri dishes. The films were allowed to dry for two days at 23 °C and 50% RH. The thickness of the films was 100 μm. "

The sample area was 5 cm^2 and the partial pressure of the oxygen was 1 atm. The OTR was normalized with respect to the oxygen pressure and material thickness to yield the oxygen permeability (OP). The results are reported as the average of two measurements. The carbon dioxide and nitrogen transmission rates were performed with a Mocon Permatran C-200, Modern Controls Inc., Minneapolis, USA, at 23 °C and 0% RH.

The thickness of all the studied materials was determined using a Thickness Tester Type 21 from Lorentzen & Wettre AB, Stockholm, Sweden, in accordance with SCAN-P 7:96. The thickness was determined at five positions on each sample. In the water absorbency tests, the apparatus used was a Cobb Sizing Tester from Lorentzen & Wettre AB, Stockholm, Sweden. The Cobb60 value was determined in accordance with ISO 535. The results are reported as the value from a single measurement. The grease resistance was measured in accordance with Tappi T-454, the turpentine oil being applied on the coated side. The results are reported as the average of five measurements.

AP = 0.001 nm / Pa s is the lower detection limit for the method used and we define this as being the value at which the coating had sealed the surface pores in the base paper. This value thus gives the coat weight, Wc, at which the pores in the base papers are sealed and a continuous chitosan film is beginning to develop. It is evident in Table 2 that Wc increased with increasing AP of the base paper. In the pilot-scale coating trial, the coat weights obtained were much lower. The highest obtained coat weight was 0.2 g / m^2. The AP decreased after coating, as shown in Fig. 2, but 0.2 g / m^2 was apparently too low a coat weight to seal the pores in the base papers, because the AP values were higher than 0.001 nm / Pa s.

In the case of the pilot-scale coated papers, the coat weight was too low to give an oxygen-barrier. The upper limit of the oxygen permeability tester used was 20,000 cm^3 / (m^2 atm day). The thickness used in the calculation of the OP was the total thickness of the coated material, i.e., coating + base paper. This thickness was determined largely by the thickness of the base paper and was 85 μm for all the coated papers independent of coat weight. The thickness of the chitosan film at coat weights of 2.4 and 5.2 g / m^2, assuming no penetration and a density of 1.5 g / cm^3 for the chitosan, was estimated to be 1.6 and 3.5 μm, respectively. In Fig. 4, the OP is plotted versus the air permeance (AP) of the base papers for two coat weights exceeding Wc. Evidently the AP of the base paper did not affect the OP-value of the coated paper. When the chitosan coating had formed a continuous film, at a coat weight of 5.2 g / m^2, it was evident that the barrier properties of the composite were determined by the coating layer. At a coat weight of 2.4 g / m^2, only the two base papers with the lowest AP-values yielded measurable OP-values, and for these the OP-value was slightly lower for the base paper with the lowest AP. Even at a coat weight of 5.2 g / m^2 the most open base paper (paper 4) also gave OP-values above the measurable range. The OP for the coated papers with a coat weight of 5.2 g / m^2 was also measured at 37 °C and 0% RH. Paper 2, with an air permeance of 3.1 nm / Pa s for the base paper, had an OP of 1.6 cm^3 mm / (m^2 24 h atm), which is of the same magnitude as the values obtained at 23 °C and 0% RH. The base papers with the highest air permeances (paper 3 and paper 4) when coated gave OP-values above the measurable range. The coated paper 1 was not measured at 37 °C and 0% RH.

174,Barrier and surface properties of chitosan-coated greaseproof paper.xml,['Discussion']," The oxygen permeability (OP) measurements at 23 °C and 0% relative humidity (RH) showed that chitosan can be used as a coating on greaseproof paper to obtain a material with oxygen-barrier properties, provided the coating seals the pores in the base paper and forms a continuous and homogeneous film. This condition was fulfilled at a coat weight of 5.2 g / m^2 for the three densest base papers and at a coat weight of 2.4 g / m^2 for the two densest base papers. On the most open base paper (AP 660 nm / Pa s) no oxygen-barrier was obtained at any of the studied coat weights. However, coat weights as high as 2.4 g / m^2 could only be obtained by bench-scale coating. On the pilot-coated material, the coat weight achieved was only 0.1 g / m^2 and at that coat weight none of the coated papers provided any oxygen-barrier. At a coat weight of 5.2 g / m^2, the measured OP-values (0.7-1.8 cm^3 mm / (m^2 atm day)) are of the same magnitude as that reported for PETP (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) (Andrew, 1995). For comparison it can be mentioned that Gällstedt, Törnqvist, and Hedenqvist (2001) have reported OP-values of 0.01-2 cm^3 mm / (day m^2 atm) at 90-95% relative humidity (RH) for chitosan films coated with nitrocellulose lacquer, and that Kittur et al. (1998) have reported an OP-value of 0.16 × 10^-5 cm^3 mm / (day m^2 atm) at 65% RH and 27 °C for pure chitosan films. However, OP-values for chitosan-coated papers cannot be directly compared with values for free chitosan films, since the thickness by which the transmission rate is normalized, is determined both by the thickness of the base paper and the thickness of the chitosan coating. The chitosan coating, which controls the OP, is thin in comparison with the base paper. Measurements of OP at a higher temperature, 37 °C and 0% RH, showed values similar to or slightly higher than those obtained at 23 °C and 0% RH for the coated sulphite base paper. The influence of the base paper seemed to increase with increasing temperature. It has earlier been reported that OP-values increase with increasing temperature (Arvanitoyannis et al., 1994). The small changes in OP-values between the two temperatures for the coated sulphite papers in this study can probably be explained by the fact that both the temperatures were far from the Tg of chitosan, which was in the range of 125-130 °C. The glass transition temperature indicates the temperature at which the molecule chains in the polymer pass from a lower degree of flexibility to higher degree of flexibility. The flexibility of the molecule chains governs gas diffusion and this increases with increasing temperature (Pauly, 1989). Measurable permeability values for carbon dioxide and nitrogen were obtained only at a coat weight of 5.2 g / m^2 on the densest base paper. The values of carbon dioxide and nitrogen permeability of the coated papers, 71 and 490 cm^3 mm / (m^2 atm day), respectively, were higher than those reported for films of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETP) or EVOH, which are in the range of 0.001-10 cm^3 mm / (m^2 atm day) (Plastics Design Library, 1995). PETP and EVOH are polymers which are considered to provide an excellent barrier against these gases. The permeability of a polymer coating such as chitosan is governed by the product S × D, where S denotes the solubility and D the diffusion coefficient. D is governed by the size of the penetrating gas molecule. The total bond length of the gases (picometres) used in the study were: oxygen 121, carbon dioxide 232 and nitrogen 110 (Lide, 1999). The smaller the molecule the higher is the penetrating rate and the higher is the value of D. A comparison of the molecule size and the measured permeability suggests (a) that the nitrogen had a higher permeability than carbon dioxide due to its smaller molecule size and (b) that nitrogen and carbon dioxide had a higher permeability than oxygen due to their greater solubility in chitosan (Makino & Hirata, 1997). The AP of the coated material had a great influence on the grease resistance. The base paper affects the grease resistance up to the coat weight, Wc, at which the air permeance of the material is below the measurable range. This coat weight is not the same for all the base papers, but increases with increasing AP of the base paper. All papers exhibited excellent grease resistance at coat weights exceeding 5 g / m^2. At lower coat weights, only the coated papers with the lowest air permeance of the base paper exhibited excellent grease resistance. The coated papers provided no barrier against water absorption. Once the base papers were coated it was obvious that the chitosan coating was the limiting factor affecting the water barrier properties of the coated material. The water sorption in the base papers increased with increasing air permeance, as is evident in Table 4. This suggests that the pore sorption increased when the AP increased. However, not only the pores in paper but also the fibres themselves take up water. The Cobb-values of 25 g / m^2 for the base papers with the lowest AP-values suggest that the up take in those papers was predominately controlled by fibre sorption. When these papers were coated, the Cobb-value increased to approximately 30 g / m^2 at the highest coat weight. This increase in the Cobb-value shows that the water sorption by the chitosan coating was higher than for the cellulose fibres in the base papers. For the base papers with higher AP-values, which had Cobb-values in the 40-50 g / m^2 range, the Cobb-value decreased to approximately 30 g / m^2 at the highest coat weight, i.e., the same as that for the base papers with the lowest AP-values. The decrease in Cobb-value is probably due to a clogging by the coating of the pores in the base paper, which reduced the pore sorption. This reduction was greater than the uptake of water by the chitosan coating. Chitosan is reported to exhibit good tensile strength and fracture strain (Arvanitoyannis et al., 1998). This was not, however, reflected in the coated paper studied in this paper. The tensile strength remained unaffected by the chitosan coating, probably because the coat weights were low in comparison with the grammage of the base papers. Thus, the tensile strength of the coated paper was controlled by the tensile strength of the base paper. The increase in fracture strain observed is probably caused by a stress relaxation in the base paper during the coating process when the base paper was exposed to the water in the coating colour. Our results are in agreement with those of Kuusipalo, Kaunisto, Laine, and Kellomäki (2005), who used chitosan as a pre-coating before extrusion coating. In the metered size press technique used in the pilot-scale coating trial, the coating was applied to the transfer roll using an engraved roll. This technique is reported to give higher coat weights than rod or roll application (Salt et al., 2002), which is the most frequently used application technique in metered size press coating. Using starch solutions of 5-18% concentration, a coat weight of 0.7-4.0 g / m^2 can be obtained (Klass, 2002). Application with an engraved roll is volumetric, i.e., with a given roll the same volume is always applied, independent of the concentration of the polymer solution. A comparison of our coat weight, 0.1 g / m^2 at a concentration of 1% , with Klass’s 0.7 g / m^2 at a concentration of 5% shows that the wet coat weight was roughly the same in our and Klass’s experiments. This shows that a coat weight greater than 0.1 g / m^2 cannot be achieved using a chitosan solution of 1.0 wt% in coating with the metered size press. The concentration of the solution must be considerably increased if a satisfactory coat weight is to be obtained. This can be achieved by using chitosan of lower molecular weight. A lower molecular weight and higher degree of deacetylation decrease the viscosity of the chitosan solution (Tsaih, Chen, & Lin, 1995). An alternative coating technique which yields higher coat weights may also be needed. Curtain coating may offer that possibility (Schweizer, 2002). "

176,Barrier properties of chitosan coated polyethylene.xml,['abstract']," The transfer properties of chitosan coated polyethylene (PE) films were studied. The barrier properties of non coated PE were not affected by relative humidity changes. The presence of the hydrophilic chitosan layer acted as a water reservoir on the polyethylene film surface which significantly promoted its sensitivity to the water vapour. The water vapour permeability increased 1.85 times at a higher RH. Coated PE films showed more than two-order decrease in the oxygen permeability (PO2) and three-order-decrease in the carbon dioxide permeability (PCO2). When the chitosan coated PE surface was exposed to the water vapour, the PO2 and the PCO2 were significantly increased. However, the permeability of the chitosan self standing film depended on the solvent type, glycerol, permeate nature and the environmental humidity. The addition of ethanol during the film processing decreased PO2, PCO2 and Pair while glycerol had the opposite effect. "

182,Barrier properties of chitosan coated polyethylene.xml,['Introduction']," The gas permeability of barrier packaging materials is of great importance for food. The barrier to moisture, oxygen, carbon dioxide or combination of hereof in a packaging system can increase the food product shelf life and improve its quality [1]. Due to a good processability, a low energy processing demand and a good resistance to chemicals and harsh environments, polyolefins have been widely used in food packaging. Common polyolefin films that are non-polar hydrocarbon polymers such as polyethylene (PE) have a good water vapour barrier property. On the other hand they must be coated or laminated with gas barrier polymers like synthetic ethylene / vinyl alcohol, EVOH, copolymers, poly(vinylidene chloride), PVDC, poly(ethylene terepthalate), PET, polyamide-6, PA-6, or different surface treatments [2]. Renewable and biodegradable biopolymers that are environmentally friendly materials have been ignored for decades. Even though it meets the gas permeability requirements, replacing food plastic packaging by self standing biopolymers is a difficult task to achieve. It is mainly due to a low cost of synthetic polymers and poor mechanical properties and water vapour sensitivity of biomaterials [3], [4]. The combination of biopolymers with common synthetic materials is a novel approach that gains more and more attention. Derived from a various natural sources (polysaccharides, lipids and proteins), biopolymers can be formed as either coatings or stand alone films [5], [6], [7]. Oxygen is the key factor that might cause oxidation, unwanted food changes and nutrient deterioration. In addition to the development of oxidative reactions where proteins and lipids degrade, if the oxygen permeability of the packaging material is too high, microorganisms present in the food can start to grow [2], [8]. Carbon dioxide is formed in some food due to the deterioration and respiration reactions [9]. CO2 may be added into a packaging to suppress microbial growth in a certain products [10]. On the other hand, high levels of a carbon dioxide, resulting from food deterioration or oxidative reactions could cause adverse quality effects in the products. Excess carbon dioxide can be removed by using highly permeable plastics whose permeability increases with higher temperatures [11]. Water vapour is a critical compound that can penetrate through the packaging materials. To avoid the moisture transfer that can affect food quality, WVP control is important to inhibit microbial growth, undesirable textural changes, to ensure stability and safety during distribution and storage [12]. The effects of a temperature and moisture content on biopolymer materials require the permeability of a packaging to reflect the conditions of intended use. Thus, measurements of permeabilities should be conducted under the specific conditions that will be encountered by a packaged product. The presence of plasticizers increases water vapour transmission of films regardless of formulation [13]. The transport properties of coated packaging materials are often influenced by coating composition. Due to their hydrophilic nature polysaccharides are highly receptive to moisture and exhibit low water vapour barrier properties [14]. Gas permeability of carbohydrate films and coatings depends on several factors such as film integrity, crystallinity, hydrophilic-hydrophobic ratio, the polymeric chain mobility, the interaction between the film-forming polymer and the presence of a plasticizer or other additives. Therefore, the design and the optimization of the coating composition are very important for food packaging materials [15]. Differences in film forming conditions between cast films and coatings were thought to be responsible for changes in oxygen permeability [16]. The permeability of barrier films is the common parameter determined to assess their mass transfer barrier properties. If Fick's laws apply, the permeability coefficient is described as the product of a thermodynamic parameter which is the sorption coefficient and a kinetic parameter which is the diffusion coefficient [17]. Chitosan (CS) is a high molecular weight polymer formed by N-acetyl-d-glucosamine units with β(1-4) glycosidic bonds. The cationic nature of the CS is due to the free amino groups left by the partial motion of acetyl groups of chitin. It can form transparent films to enhance the quality and extend the storage life of food products [18]. Changes in solvent polarity may change structure and final film properties. Moreover, plasticizers may cause significant changes in the film barrier properties. In order to improve physical, functional and barrier properties of chitosan films, blending it with both biodegradable and synthetic materials has been proposed. Chitosan blends could replace synthetic polymers in many applications, reducing the thickness of the plastic components attaining the same overall performances and also reducing the problems of disposability of traditional plastics [3], [19], [20]. Detailed understanding of the characteristics of coated films is of a great practical and commercial importance. This study aimed to form chitosan coatings on the LDPE films. Developed coatings were analysed for their barrier properties against water vapour, oxygen, carbon dioxide and air. The effect of the temperature and the relative humidity on the barrier characteristics of the chitosan coated PE films was also investigated. "

Anhydrous glycerol (GLY) (Fluka Chemical, 98% purity, Germany) was used as a plasticizer in order to improve the mechanical film properties. Acetic acid (glacial 100% , Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and pure ethanol (absolute, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as solvents in the preparation of the film forming solutions (FFS). Magnesium chloride (MgCl2, Sigma), sodium chloride (NaCl, Sigma) and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7, Sigma) were used to prepare saturated salt solutions to fix the relative humidity for water vapour and gas permeability measurements.

189,Barrier properties of chitosan coated polyethylene.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Water vapour permeability', 'Influence of coating process on the water vapour permeability (WVP) of polyethylene']"," Polyethylene films are known to be very hydrophobic and relatively not very permeable to water vapour. The WVP of PE film was similar (Table 1) to those of the most commercial polymer films like polypropylene (6.5 × 10^-13 g m / m^2 Pa s) and polyvinyl chloride (7.1 × 10^-13 g m / m^2 Pa s) [22]. Therefore, it was interesting to verify if the deposit of a chitosan layer on the PELD would alter its water vapour barrier properties. The water vapour permeability of uncoated PE was not sensitive to the relative humidity increase. The WVP of untreated PE was 5 × 10^-13 g / m s Pa. However, the water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) increased with the relative humidity (RH) gradient from 0.55±0.05 × 10^-5 to 1.84±0.08 × 10^-5 and 2.55±0.39 × 10^-5 g / m^2 s when the gradient varied, 0-33% , 30-75% and 30-100% RH, respectively. As PE film one often considered as non water sensitive, thus WVP remains not influenced by gradient, when it is coated by a biopolymer, this property seems to be lost. The presence of hygroscopic chitosan layer can act as a water reservoir on the PE surface, thus significantly promoting its water vapour permeability. Accordingly, chitosan interacts easily with the surroundings, absorbing water from the environmental humid air and therefore undergoing significant physical changes. In particular, the chitosan / water interaction leads both to an increased mobility in the hydrophilic macromolecule chains and to the swelling of the polysaccharide network. They are at the base of the gas diffusivity and gas solubility phenomena, respectively [23]. It is likely that high water sorption by chitosan induces surface water concentration much higher in the liquid state and thus increases its permeability. Swelling also disrupted the structural integrity and barrier properties of the polymer network [24]. This hypothesis could be tested by determining the water content of the films in the steady state, but it is not precise enough to confirm it. To test this hypothesis, we exposed the coated side to lower humidity with the same gradients (Table 1, PECSEinv). Thus WVP decreased for at least 15% when the face of PE coated with chitosan is exposed to lower humidity (Table 1), which tends to confirm mentioned above. Even though the presence of the biocoating did not lead to any significant changes in WVP of the PE films; still higher WVP of coated samples at higher ΔRH was observed (Table 1). This could explain that PE films are excellent water vapour barriers, and the addition of a thin layer coating was not enough to affect their initial performances at tested temperature (25 °C). Similar observations were reported for PET and OPP fat / protein coated films [3]. At ΔRH 75% , higher WVP can be attributed to the very high increase in solubility. A decrease in the diffusivity appears to be accompanied by the formation of water clusters [25] thus increasing water vapour permeability at higher RH (Table 1). "

192,Barrier properties of chitosan coated polyethylene.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Water vapour permeability', 'Influence of casting solvent and glycerol on WVP of self standing chitosan films']"," Table 1 displays the WVP of all self standing tested films, at 0 / 33% , 30 / 75% , 30 / 100% relative humidity differentials. The WVP of two films based on chitosan (CSA and CSE) was tested at different RH gradients to highlight the effect of the solvent nature (acetic acid (A) or ethanol (E)) during the film preparation. When ethanol was used, the pH of the solution changed (from 4.5 to 5.2). This could modify the structure of the film due to variation in the polarity and thus of the solubility and the interfacial tension. Thus the obtained films were denser and their sensitivity to the plasticizing effect of water was reduced. In addition, ethanol concentration affected the solubility of CS and this resulted in different permeabilities of dry films. At water partial pressure between 0.4 and 0.54 the transport mechanism changed from a Fickian process to an anomalous process. A second important increase in water vapour flows was observed when partial pressure was above 0.95 [26]. Glycerol reduces the interactions between polymer chains, increases their mobility and thus it was used as a plasticizer of chitosan films. The obtained films were more flexible and less brittle. However, glycerol is also known for its antidepressant properties and therefore its strong hygroscopicity [27]. As a result, it promotes the sorption of water to relative humidities above 80% , and under these conditions the plasticizing effect of water is additional to that of glycerol, thus explaining higher WVP. At high hydration level, the water molecules partially dissolved the CS to form a gel in which interactions among the polar groups of CS and additives were promoted. The mobility of the polymer chains increased and the packaging density was reduced. Thus, there was a significant increase in its water sorption capacity [28], [29]. An increase in the interchain spacing caused by the inclusion of glycerol molecules between the polymer chains may promote water vapour diffusivity through the film and, hence, accelerate the water vapour transmission. The increases in WVP arising from plasticizer addition reported in this study are consistent with other authors’ findings [30], [31]. Caner et al. [32] reported that chitosan films had a WVP ranging from 14.92 × 10^-13 to 611.0 × 10^-13 g / m s Pa (at 25 °C and 50-100% RH), influenced by different acids and plasticizers. Water molecules play an important role in the packing and conformation of chitosan chains. Higher solubility of glycerol in hydroalcoholic medium may cause better distribution, therefore decreasing the number of the lattice between polymer chains and pathways for water permeation. Since WVTR through chitosan is a diffusion process, it is reasonable to expect that WVP is more strongly influenced by changes in the lattice volume fraction than by changes in the lattice dimensions. Therefore, permeability of CSEGLY was ten times lower at lower RH gradient, in comparison with higher RH gradient (Table 1). Karbowiak et al. [33] showed that the increase in the diffusivity of water, or other small molecules in biopolymer films, is directly related to the water content and not that of the plasticizer added. The adsorbed water induces a plasticization of the chitosan network which increases the mobility of polymer chains. This could be attributed to the higher diffusivity due to weak intra-and intermolecular attractive forces in the polymer matrix. This phenomenon is favoured by the relative humidity increase. Chitosan glycerol plasticized films had higher WVP values than PE (Table 1), cast and extruded glycerol plasticized oat starch (0.042 × 10^-10 g / m s Pa and 0.22 × 10^-10 g / m s Pa, respectively) [34] and methylcellulose (0.50 × 10^-10 g / m s Pa) [35]. However, these values were lower than for glycerol plasticized wheat gluten (7.00 × 10^-10 g / m s Pa) and amylose films (3.80 × 10^-10 g / m s Pa) [14]. The lowest values were obtained for CSE plasticized films (3.48 × 10^-10 g / m s Pa, Table 1). Moreover, the authors reported that the WVTR of polysaccharide films were related to their thickness [35], [36], [37]. During preparation, including film casting, drying and edge effects differences in film thicknesses are commonly observed, therefore it was expected to experience the difficulty of minimizing induced variations.

193,Barrier properties of chitosan coated polyethylene.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Oxygen, carbon dioxide and air permeability', 'Influence of coating process on gas permeability of coated PE']"," Biopolymer films are aimed to be good gas barrier. To investigate the ability of chitosan coating in enhancing barrier properties of traditional polyolefin films, polyethylene films were coated with thin chitosan layer (3 and 6 μm). For most plastic films, CO2 permeability is from 2 to 6 times greater than that of O2 and provides a range of selectivity. This allows a large selection of films of suitable ratios for specific food products [38]. PCO2 (Fig. 2) was found to be two times higher than PO2 (Fig. 1) for tested PE film. In dry conditions PCO2 (1.02 × 10^-17g / m s Pa) was lower than PO2 (6.18 × 10^-17g / m s Pa) for chitosan coated PE films (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The application of chitosan coatings on PE films showed more than two-order decrease in oxygen permeability and three-order-decrease in carbon dioxide permeability (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) in comparison to the uncoated PE. Pair was found to be lower than PO2 and PCO2 (2.66 × 10^-17 and 2.08 × 10^-18 g / m s Pa, for 3 and 6 μm chitosan coated PE, respectively). Thermal analysis [39] did not display changes in the PE structure after PE films were coated. Therefore, the decrease in PO2 and PCO2 can only be attributed to the chitosan layer. Good barrier materials are considered if having PO2 less than 2.44 × 10-17 g m / m^2 s Pa at 23 °C [40]. According to this criterion, the chitosan coated PE was classified as excellent oxygen barrier. In a humidified environment, the CO2 / O2 of coated samples increased. Moreover, the α increased with the coating thickness increase (from 2.2 to 33.6 for 3 and 6 μm coatings, respectively). The high polarity of CO2 causes its better dissolution, condensability and higher solubility than O2 (Henry's law solubility constants for CO2 and O2 in water at 25 °C indicates that CO2 (1.01 × 10^-2 cm^3 (STP) / cm^3 cmHg) is 26 times more soluble than O2 (3.75 × 10^-4 cm^3 (STP) / cm^3 cmHg) [41], therefore PCO2>PO2. The high permeability caused by higher diffusivity of CO2 could be due to the lower kinetic diameter, 3.3 Å and 3.46 Å for CO2 and O2, respectively. The presence of the water vapour close to the hydrophilic polymer surface changed the structure of the thin chitosan coating and resulted in preferential permeation for acid gases such as CO2. From the application point of view, in a preservation of fresh products with high water content, low PO2 and high PCO2 inhibits growth of aerobic microorganisms, thus increasing the product shelf life. The degree to which atmospheric modification takes place in the packages depends on the film permeability, product respiration and the influence of temperature on both of these processes [42]. Gases such as O2, CO2 and water vapour exit or enter the package in a controlled manner and therefore, special films could be obtained by modifying the film manufacturing process. Also, they could meet aerobic respiration needs and maintain desirable CO2 and moisture levels. It was found that PCO2 / PO2 of PE chitosan coated film was 5.5 at 25 °C and 96% RH. The temperature increase from 4 to 25 °C resulted in PO2 rise for all tested films (Fig. 3). As temperature increases, molecules have more energy and they can move much more easily through both PE part and chitosan coating. There is also a thermal expansion of the polymer material [17]. On the other hand when humidity increased, that effect was not so pronounced (PO2=2.44,0.54and6.40 times higher for the PE, PE chitosan coated and chitosan films, respectively). PO2 generally follows an Arrhenius type of the equation, unless the polymer passes through a transition such as the glass transition temperature [42]. The Arrhenius model applied to oxygen permeation has been confirmed both for some biosourced [43] and polyolefins [44]. Lower difference observed for humidified samples was due to the sorption of water molecules onto the coating surface that formed previously mentioned water reservoir. Therefore it facilitated and increased oxygen permeation. There was no significant difference in activation energy between dry and humidified PE samples (36.62 and 37.69 kJ / mol, respectively). On the other hand, the activation energy values of the PE chitosan coated (113.26 kJ / mol) and the chitosan self standing films (160.282 kJ / mol) were higher than those of the uncoated PE (36.62 kJ / mol). That indicates that the oxygen permeation through the PE coated films is more sensitive to temperature changes than that of commercial PE. Lower values at higher moisture rates (25.88 and 78.26 kJ / mol for coated PE and CS films) indicate that oxygen permeation depends more on humidity change than to temperature increase. Greater correlation of PO2 and RH than PO2 and temperature was observed by Hong and Krochta [7]. The permeability of the whey-protein-coated films increased exponentially with RH (in the range from 30 to 85% at 25 °C) and twofold increase for each 10 °C was observed. The exponential effect of RH on oxygen permeability has been previously observed for other biopolymer films [36], [45]. "

The oxygen permeability of the CSA film was lower than previously reported (883 × 10^-17 g / m s Pa [46]). We also noticed that some structural changes in chitosan films occurred depending on the solvent nature and plasticizer addition [39]. The general transport mechanism for a gas through polymeric material starts with a sorption of the gas molecules to the surface and then the dissolution in the polymer matrix. The next step is a diffusion step, described as a series of jumps from one cavity to another within the polymer matrix. At the final step gas molecules are desorbed from the other side of the material. From a kinetic point of view, in a layered chitosan structure pathways for gas permeation are much longer and this results in lower gas permeabilities. In dry conditions, PCO2 and PO2 were very close (Table 2). Permeating moist gas turns hydrophilic polymer chains into a swollen state and greatly increases gas permeability. This phenomenon was more pronounced for the CO2 (from 5 to 238 times) than for the O2 (from 4 to 42 times) and led to an increase in the selectivity (56). Actually, after drying there is always a trace of acetic acid left. High solubility of CO2 in acids and its interaction with the chitosan molecules makes CO2 preferentially more permeable [47]. Likewise it may enhance the transport of the CO2 through the chitosan films. Generally, the selectivity of CO2 / O2 found in this research was lower than that of [26] (16.7). The addition of the ethanol during processing decreased PO2, PCO2 and Pair. During the film preparation several events may occur, such as the structural orientation and conformation changes of chitosan matrix. It was attributed to the interactions between acetic acid and chitosan chains that strengthen the film network. Such events can facilitate diffusion through the expanded form of the chitosan network in a manner that restricts the flow of gases [48]. Water molecules interact with polar groups in the matrix, gas molecules enter in the micro-channels within the film structure and material swells which results in varying permeability. Disturbing presence of water and the molecular orientation of the polymeric chains may hinder the movement of gas molecules [49]. The final reason could be increase in the material polarity [2]. The PO2 of the plasticized chitosan films was from 2.2 to 8.4 and from 3.5 to 8.2 times higher than unplasticized one (at 0 and 96% relative humidity, respectively). Since the chitosan films had relatively high moisture contents (up to 20% for self standing films) and water is itself an effective chitosan plasticizer, when adsorbed it influences the plasticizing ability of glycerol and it can lower Tg and thus increase permeability [2]. The rupture of hydrogen bonds may create additional sites for the molecule dissolution and may increase mobility of the O2 molecules within the amorphous phase [50]. The most important difference was observed for permeating air, being from 5.6 to 9 times higher for plasticized samples. The higher the relative humidity, the greater the effect of the plasticizer on the oxygen permeability of sorbitol plasticized starch films (from 3.5 to 718 times at a relative humidity from 57 to 90% ) [51]. The authors [32] found that the oxygen permeability of the chitosan film ranged from 1.32 to 514 g / m s Pa, according to the type of acids and plasticizers. "

200,Barrier properties of chitosan coated polyethylene.xml,['Conclusion']," The casting of the chitosan coating onto the polyethylene films enhanced their gas barrier properties at low relative humidities. In dry conditions, the coated films were from 100 to 1000 times less permeable than the polyolefin film with the following permeation order PCO2>PO2>Pair. Even though polyolefins are expected not to be sensitive to water vapour gradient, contrarily WVP of coated films was increased. Therefore, it was undoubtedly attributed to chitosan coating. Due to its hydrophilicity, the chitosan coating negatively influenced the water vapour barrier properties of the PE films. Still, statistically no significant difference was observed. A rise of the relative humidity decreased the barrier performances of the chitosan and probably changed its structure. Therefore, gas barrier properties at high humidity were also affected. Permeability at the higher moisture level increased with the coating thickness increase. Polymer structure, physical properties (solubility and diffusivity of CO2 and plasticization effect of water molecules) and polymer / gas interactions influenced the permeation flow particularly in the humid environment, but still followed the same order PCO2>PO2. On the other hand, gas transfer through the self standing chitosan film was influenced by the casting solvent and the plasticizers. Glycerol facilitated the mobility of the penetrate. Ethanol increased the polymer density and changed the network polarity. Therefore it decreased the permeation in the dry state but negatively affected it in the wet state. "

207,Barrier properties of model epoxy nanocomposites.xml,['Introduction']," Polymeric materials have long been utilized for packaging applications. However, overwhelming demands in the marketplace have put significant pressure for material developers to pursue novel routes to manufacture low cost packaging films with greatly improved barrier properties. Typical approaches to lower permeability of polymeric materials are to apply barrier coating on the film surface, such as aluminum metallization on polymer surfaces [1], and to laminate expensive high barrier material, such as ethylene vinyl alcohol [2] and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [3], between less expensive, but stronger films. However, such approaches are usually too expensive and cannot achieve desired long-term barrier properties needs [2]. The emergence of polymer nanocomposites introduces a new opportunity to improve barrier properties of polymers. When the nanoplatelets are well exfoliated, in addition to the improved barrier property, polymer nanocomposites usually exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and better thermal stability [4], [5], [6], which adds extra values for polymer nanocomposites using as packaging materials. Initial commercial target of polymer nanocomposites is for high barrier packaging applications, such as food packaging [7]. As a result, the barrier properties of polymer nanocomposites have been extensively investigated based on a wide range of polymer matrices, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) [8], [9], polyethylene (PE) [10], [11], poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [12], polyamide [13], polyimide [14], polyurethane [15], poly(ɛ-caprolactone) [16], [17], polylactide [18], epoxy [19], [20], natural rubber [21], styrene-butadiene rubber [22], acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber [23], and Nafion^® [24], for different targeted applications. In addition to the study on permeability of oxygen [11], [13], [18], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], moisture [11], [27], [28], [30], carbon dioxide [11], [31], nitrogen [11], [21], [31], and liquid water [32], [33], for regular food packing [7] and coating applications [33], permeability studies on special gases and liquids, such as hydrogen [13], helium [13], [19], methanol [24], [34], ethanol [35], toluene [35], and acetone [36], have also been performed for hydrogen storage [19] and fuel cell [24] applications. These promising applications in turn fuel intensive researches on polymer nanocomposites for barrier properties improvement. Significant improvement on barrier properties by up to two to three orders of magnitude has been reported [29], [37]. Most studies on polymer nanocomposite barrier properties are based on the tortuous pathway concept [38], where the nanofiller phase is assumed to be impermeable for gas and liquid molecules. Quite a few models have been developed based on this concept and will be discussed in more detail later. It has also been noticed that the interaction between certain polymer matrices and nanoplatelets can affect crystallinity, molecular orientation, and packing of the molecules near the nanoplatelets [39]. The alteration of the molecular packing around the nanoplatelets may further enhance the barrier properties of polymer nanocomposites. Wang et al. [22] reported that the layered rectorite has a strong effect on restraining polymer chain mobility, which resulted in the decrease of fractional free volume. This, in turn, helps to improve the barrier property of styrene-butadiene rubber / rectorite nanocomposite. It has also been reported that the incorporation of montmorillonite (MMT) clay into Nylon 6 favors the formation of γ-form crystals. This resulted in an increased matrix crystallinity and decreased crystalline dimension, both of which help to improve the barrier properties [35]. Gain et al. [16] found that in exfoliated poly(ɛ-caprolactone) / MMT nanocomposites, the permeability is decreased as the grafting density of poly(ɛ-caprolactone) chains on the MMT surface is increased. Gardebien et al. [40] conducted molecular simulation of exfoliated poly(ɛ-caprolactone) / MMT nanocomposites. They found a layered poly(ɛ-caprolactone) structure formed near the MMT surface with a higher density than the amorphous poly(ɛ-caprolactone). These higher density polymer layers effectively “thicken” the MMT nanoplatelets and narrow the permeation pathways, which remarkably improves their barrier properties. On the other hand, poor interface between nanoplatelets and matrix will usually result in decreased barrier properties [10], [27], [28]. Parallel to the experimental studies, modeling of the barrier properties of polymer nanocomposites has also been well developed. Even before the successful preparation of polymer nanocomposite, Nielsen [38] carried out modeling of the barrier properties of polymer composites containing oriented and regularly arrayed filler based on a tortuous pathway concept. This model has been widely accepted and fits experimental observations well in some cases [11], [12], [14], [21]. Cussler et al. conducted systematic studies and proposed new models to take into account additional factors, including the shape, dimension polydispersity, and array of the dispersed nanoplatelets [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49]. The diffusion in nanocomposite containing oriented, randomly arrayed disks was molded by both Fredrickson and Bicerano [50], and Gusev and Lusti [51] based on a second-order approximation from a multiple scattering formulation and finite element calculation, respectively. Bharadwaj [52] modified Nielsen's model by incorporating a new order parameter to take the orientation of the nanoplatelets into account. In addition, models proposed by Aris [53], Lu and Mai [54], Swannack et al. [55], Sorrentino et al. [56], have also received significant attention. In the present work, we report our experimental results regarding how the nanoplatelets exfoliation level and aspect ratio affect the nanocomposite barrier properties by using synthetic α-zirconium phosphate (ZrP) nanoplatelets. Epoxy / ZrP nanocomposites have been systematically studied in the past few years [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65]. The utilization of ZrP for the preparation of polymer nanocomposites has been shown to be ideal for fundamental studies of intercalation process [59], [65] and structure-property relationship [57], [58], [62], [63], [64] of polymer nanocomposites. Polymer nanocomposites containing three distinctive levels of exfoliation and two different aspect ratios of ZrP nanoplatelets have been designed and successfully prepared. These model systems are ideal for experimental investigations of their effects on the barrier properties of polymer nanocomposites. Implications of polymer nanocomposites for packaging applications are discussed. "

The aspect ratios of the two pristine ZrP nanoplatelets were initially estimated based on their average lateral dimension from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of respective ZrP crystals [60] and the individual ZrP layer thickness, which has been determined by ZrP crystal structure studies [67], [68]. The aspect ratios of ZrP nanoplatelets in the model epoxy nanocomposites were estimated based on the representative nanoplatelet lengths obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [63], [64]. The aspect ratio values acquired from both SEM and TEM characterizations show a good agreement. Commercially available monoamine, polyoxyalkyleneamine (Jeffamine^® M600, Huntsman Chemical) and tetra-n-butyl ammonium hydroxide (TBA, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as intercalating agent for the preparation of model nanocomposites with three different levels of exfoliation and with two different nanoplatelets aspect ratios, respectively (Table 1). Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) epoxy (D.E.R.^® 332, The Dow Chemical Company) and 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS, Aldrich) were used as the epoxy resin and curing agent, respectively.

212,Barrier properties of model epoxy nanocomposites.xml,['Results and discussion']," It has been widely accepted that both degree of exfoliation [16], [20], [28] and nanoplatelets aspect ratio [25], [34] play an important role in the nanocomposite barrier properties. However, most of the studies were carried out based on nanocomposites that contain different compositions. That is, either different nanoplatelets of MMT, laptonite, and magadiite [34], or different polymer matrices were chosen to achieve different aspect ratio [25] or different exfoliation level [20] in the nanocomposites. Variations in compositions make it difficult to unambiguously determine and model how the nanoplatelet exfoliation level and aspect ratio affect the barrier properties of polymer nanocomposites. The uniqueness of the present study is that epoxy nanocomposites containing three distinctive levels of exfoliation and two different aspect ratios of ZrP nanoplatelets have been successfully prepared and characterized without structural or compositional changes in each set of the model system. Thus, the present study can help reveal how significant the level of exfoliation and aspect ratio of nanoplatelets affect the barrier properties of epoxy nanocomposites, and their corresponding physics. The detailed preparation of the two sets of model epoxy / ZrP nanocomposites with variations in level of exfoliation and aspect ratio have been reported elsewhere [61], [63], [64]. For clarity, representative morphologies of these two sets of model epoxy / ZrP nanocomposite films are shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, respectively. As presented in Fig. 1(A), (B), and (D), three distinctive levels of exfoliation of ZrP-100 nanoplatelets in epoxy (2.0 vol% ) can be clearly differentiated as (a) poorly exfoliated, which contains a mixture of tactoids and intercalated nanoplatelets; (b) moderately exfoliated, which contains a mixture of intercalated and exfoliated nanoplatelets; and (c) fully exfoliated, which consists of exfoliated nanoplatelets only. Fig. 2 displays the TEM images of fully exfoliated ZrP-100 and ZrP-1000 nanoplatelets in epoxy at 0.7 vol% ZrP loading. Fig. 2(A) clearly shows random orientation of ZrP nanoplatelets. In Fig. 2(B) and (C), ZrP-1000 nanoplatelets exhibit significant curvature in epoxy. It should be noted that when the concentration of ZrP-1000 is above 0.7 vol% , the viscosity becomes too high for handling and removal of trapped air. As a result, only 0.7 vol% of ZrP was incorporated into epoxy for the investigation of aspect ratio effect on the barrier properties. Based on the tortuous path theory, the relative permeability can be generally expressed by the following equation [13], [37]:(2)Rp=PPo=1-ϕτwhere Rp is relative permeability; P is the permeability coefficient of polymer nanocomposite; Po is the permeability coefficient of the neat polymer; ϕ is nanoplatelet loading level (vol% ); and τ is the tortuosity factor, which is defined as the ratio of actual distance to the shortest distance that a penetrant molecule needs to travel. Extensive studies have been devoted to calculate the tortuosity factor based on different approaches and levels of sophistication or approximation [38], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56]. Here, we focus on the models dealing with particles having a plate-like shape. Table 2 presents brief descriptions of the models discussed in this report, which are mainly based on the excellent overviews by Takahashi et al. [37] and by Picard et al. [13]. To be noted, some formulas presented in Table 2 have been modified slightly from the original ones so that the six models listed in Table 2 follows the same aspect ratio definition [13], [37]. The factor (1-ϕ) has also been incorporated to each model for consistency [13], [37]. The modeling details for each model can be found in their corresponding original literature. In order to avoid complexity when correlating experimental data with the above models, experiments were carried out based on oxygen permeability, rather than moisture permeability [27]. Moisture has been shown to interact with either polymer matrix or intercalating agent, or both [11], [27]. The oxygen permeability coefficients of the two sets of model epoxy / ZrP nanocomposite films were calculated and listed in Table 3. The relative permeabilities of the model nanocomposites with three distinctive levels of exfoliation are plotted in Fig. 3 and compared with the models. The incorporation of 2.0 vol% of poorly exfoliated ZrP nanoplatelets decreases the oxygen permeability by only ca. 19% . As exfoliation level is improved, the corresponding nanocomposites exhibit enhanced barrier properties. In the case of the well-exfoliated sample, its oxygen permeability is reduced to about 51% of neat epoxy. The results clearly demonstrate that the exfoliation level of nanoplatelets does affect the barrier properties of polymers nanocomposites significantly. At the filler loading of 2.0 vol% , the relative permeability value of well-exfoliated nanocomposite shows good agreements with the Gusev-Lusti model, the Nielsen model, and the Cussler model (regular array). As presented in Table 2, most of the models (except for the Bharadwaj model) assume the nanoplatelets to be aligned perfectly parallel to the membrane surface, which apparently is not the case for most of the nanocomposites. Interestingly, according to some rheology model predictions [69] as well as experimental findings [62], [63], as the nanoplatelet concentration is increased to a certain level, the nanoplatelets tend to orient among themselves due to space constraining effect of the neighboring nanoplatelets. As shown in Fig. 1(D), at a loading of 2.0 vol% , the ZrP nanoplatelets do exhibit high level of orientation. This is probably the reason why the experimental data match these three models well. And because of the local nanoplatelet orientation, the experimental data significantly deviate from the Bharadwaj model which assumes a state of random dispersion. To confirm the above conjecture, one sample with a lower concentration (1.0 vol% ) at full exfoliation was prepared on purpose for comparison. As expected, the nanoplatelets exhibit random dispersion as shown in Fig. 1(C) due to lack of space constraint effect. The relative barrier permeability was measured to be 0.73, which is higher than the prediction by the Gusev-Lusti model and the Nielsen model. This discrepancy is apparently because of the random orientation of the nanoplatelets in the 1.0 vol% loading sample. However, this value is still lower than Bharadwaj's model prediction for a random dispersion system. This is probably because nanoplatelet orientation is not 100% random in the sample owing to the casting process during which a low level of nanoplatelet orientation is formed. The same data are also re-plotted as a function of aspect ratio and presented in Fig. 4. Considering that Gusev-Lusti's model can correlate well with the fully exfoliated nanocomposites system containing 2.0 vol% nanoplatelets, the model is then used to estimate the effective aspect ratio of the ZrP nanoplatelets with poor and moderate exfoliation. As shown in Fig. 4, the effective aspect ratios of poor and moderate exfoliation systems are ca. 15 and 60, respectively. These effective aspect ratio values are close to the TEM observation (Fig. 1) if the effective aspect ratio is defined as the length divided by the thickness of the ZrP tactoids or the intercalated ZrP nanoplatelets. The relative permeabilities of the model nanocomposites with different nanoplatelets aspect ratios at 0.7 vol% ZrP loading are also plotted and compared with the model predictions (Fig. 5). The oxygen permeability of epoxy / ZrP-100 is found to decrease by ca. 23% . The value fits well with several models, especially with the Fredrickson-Bicerano model. Again, the slight overestimation by Gusev-Lusti's model and Nielsen's model can be explained by the orientation effect discussed above. While for epoxy / ZrP-1000, an approximately 58% decrease in oxygen permeability is observed under the same condition. The much higher reduction in oxygen permeability is obviously due to the significantly higher aspect ratio of ZrP-1000 nanoplatelets. However, when compared to the models, the relative permeability of epoxy / ZrP-1000 is still higher than the prediction by any of the models, except for the Bharadwaj model (S = 0). To account for such a discrepancy, TEM was performed to observe the morphology of ZrP-1000 in the nanocomposite film. As shown in Fig. 2(B) and (C), unlike the ZrP-100 nanoplatelets, ZrP-1000 nanoplatelets exhibit severe curvature. Such a curling characteristic of ZrP-1000 nanoplatelets dramatically decreases the effective aspect ratio of ZrP-1000. Since all the models discussed here assume the nanoplatelets to be flat, the discrepancy between experimental data and model estimation can be simply due to the curling of the nanoplatelets. An attempt is made to correlate the experimental permeability data with the model, as displayed in Fig. 5. The models suggest that the effective aspect ratio of ZrP-1000 should be between 230 and 730, depending on the model utilized. Considering overall the relative permeability correlates best with the Gusev-Lusti model and the Nielsen model, the corresponding aspect ratio of ZrP-1000 is estimated to be ca. 400. Since ZrP-1000 nanoplatelets are curved, it is more reasonable to correlate the barrier properties with the effective aspect ratio of the nanoplatelets. The curved nanoplatelets should have a lower effective aspect ratio than the flat nanoplatelets. As illustrated in Fig. 2(C), the effective aspect ratio can be referred to as the diameter of the dashed circle divided by the thickness of the nanoplatelet. Overall, according to Fig. 2(B), the average effective aspect ratio is estimated to be ca. 400, which matches the prediction of Gusev-Lusti's model and Nielson's model well. The possible reasons that cause the large aspect ratio nanoplatelets to curl have been discussed elsewhere [61]. The curling of nanoplatelets obviously complicates the structure-property relationship of polymer nanocomposites. As far as barrier property is concerned, the curling of nanoplatelets shortens the effective aspect ratio, thus reducing the physical tortuous pathway. It should be noted that the curling of nanoplatelets is observed not only on ZrP nanoplatelets but also on other nanoplatelets, such as MMT clay. In fact, MMT clay exhibits a higher degree of curling even at lower aspect ratios, probably because clay nanoplatelets are less rigid than ZrP [57]. Thus, the curling of nanoplatelets in nanocomposites is quite common, and should be considered in quantitative structure-property relationship modeling work. The above findings have demonstrated that both the nanoplatelet exfoliation level and aspect ratio have significant effect on the barrier properties of polymer nanocomposites. At 2.0 vol% loading level and having a nanoplatelet aspect ratio of about 100, the full exfoliation system is about 2.5 times more effective than poor exfoliation system in reducing oxygen permeability. However, to achieve full exfoliation at high loading levels, much more efforts in terms of sophisticated manufacturing processes and cost might be required. Alternatively, at low loading level, when the aspect ratio of the nanoplatelet is increased from 100 to 1000, the barrier properties of the nanocomposite can also be greatly improved. Even at a low loading of 0.7 vol% , ZrP-1000 nanoplatelets can help achieve higher barrier property than the ZrP-100 nanoplatelets at 2.0 vol% loading level. At a higher filler loading level, the improvement from ZrP-1000 is expected to be even more significant according to each of the six models discussed above. However, as aforementioned, the increase in aspect ratio will also bring about negative effect on processing due to the significantly increased viscosity. In addition, the nanoplatelets with high aspect ratio are usually more difficult to be intercalated and exfoliated. Thus, care should be taken in determining the most effective approaches to improve barrier properties of polymer nanocomposites. Overall, it has been shown that both the Gusev-Lusti model and the Nielsen model correlate with the experimental data well. It is not surprising that Gusev-Lusti's model gives a good prediction of the relative permeability of the model nanocomposites since the assumptions of Gusev-Lusti's 3D model correspond well with the exfoliation state and nanoplatelet orientation of the samples prepared. However, it is somewhat surprising that Nielsen's simple 2D model also give a good prediction. Careful observation of the nanoplatelets dispersion in the model epoxy nanocomposites reveals an overall well-spaced nanoplatelet-to-nanoplatelet distance due to the narrow size distribution of the synthetic ZrP (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Consequently, the actual dispersion of the nanoplatelets in epoxy is close to a regular-array scenario. And because of such an overall well-spaced nanoplatelet-to-nanoplatelet distance and uniform distribution of nanoplatelets in the samples, the 3D arrangement of nanoplatelets in polymer matrix can be reduced to a 2D arrangement at a 2.0 vol% loading level as shown in Table 2. Thus, Nielsen's 2D model still gives a good prediction of the relative permeability. It should be noted that a certain level of nanoplatelet orientation will likely be formed in exfoliated polymer nanocomposites, especially when nanoplatelet concentration is high. Since most models assume the nanoplatelets to be oriented, it is not surprising that the experimental data obtained in this study fit well with some of the models. It is worth noting that thermoplastic nanocomposites processed via extrusion and injection molding processes usually possess a high degree of nanoplatelet orientation along the flow direction [13]. Such processing steps would also help straighten the ZrP-1000 nanoplatelets structure. As a result, some of the models listed in Table 2 are quite useful for predicting barrier properties of commercial polymer nanocomposite systems. On the other hand, the nanocomposites prepared via in situ polymerization, only form loose nanoplatelet orientation, if any. Thus, it would be important to take into consideration of the processing effect when selecting suitable models for describing the barrier properties of polymer nanocomposites. Meanwhile, the above findings and previous studies [70] strongly indicate that, in order to maximize the barrier properties, one may want to optimize nanoplatelet orientation via processing. According to the Bharadwaj model [52], from random dispersion to oriented dispersion, the barrier properties can be theoretically improved by up to 200% . Thus, processing-induced nanoplatelet orientation should be considered for preparing polymer nanocomposites for packaging applications. "

As expected, the barrier properties of polymer nanocomposites can be significantly affected by both the level of exfoliation and the aspect ratio of dispersed nanoplatelets. The experimental data were also correlated with a number of established semi-empirical and physical models. Both the Gusev-Lusti model and the Nielsen model appear to correlate well with the experimental data.

222,Barrier properties of nylon 6-montmorillonite nanocomposite membranes prepared by melt blending Influence of the clay content and dispersion state Consequences on modelling.xml,['abstract']," Polyamide 6-montmorillonites membranes have been prepared and studied for a large range of clay content (from 0 to 18 wt.% ). The barrier properties of these systems have been determined for different diffusing molecules varying by their kinetic diameter and their interaction capacity. The relative permeability has been found to be independent on the diffusing molecule showing that a tortuosity effect is at the origin of the improved barrier properties. The crystalline morphology of the polyamide matrix has been shown to be only slightly dependent on the nanocomposite composition. Consequently, the permeation properties have been related to the clay content and dispersion. From a quantitative description of the montmorillonite particle dispersion, the ability of different geometrical models to describe the experimental relative permeability data is discussed. This modelling leads to the conclusion that it is necessary to consider the polydispersity of the impermeable filler shapes and to take into account the presence of surfactant located at the inorganic surface to appropriately model the transport properties of the nanocomposites in a large range of nanoclay contents.

228,Barrier properties of nylon 6-montmorillonite nanocomposite membranes prepared by melt blending Influence of the clay content and dispersion state Consequences on modelling.xml,['Introduction']," Polymer nanocomposites films based on impermeable lamellar fillers such as montmorillonites have received considerable attention since they may lead to enhanced barrier properties with far less filler content than conventional composite films [1], [2], [3], [4]. As organic active films [5], these membranes are able to increase the time lag but they can also drastically reduce the steady-state gas flux. A tortuosity effect is generally considered to be at the origin of the diffusion and permeability decrease. Several models based on geometrical considerations have been developed to define the tortuosity factor as a function of the clay shape and content [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Most of these models [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] have been developed for diluted or semi-diluted systems and consider monodisperse flakes which are exclusively composed of the inorganic part of the fillers. The proposed equations are well adapted to membranes containing exclusively exfoliated structures and become less accurate as the dispersion of the silicate sheets is more complex, i.e. when different types of structures from exfoliated ones to intercalated ones co-exist. However such a kind of morphology is often observed, particularly for an intermediate and large clay content which justifies that additional models have been further proposed to consider polydisperse flakes [11], [12]. These models take into account a distribution of the impermeable flakes dimensions considering variations of width and constant thickness. The aim of this work is to study blown polyamide based nanocomposites membranes in a wide range of clay contents and to discuss the gas transport properties of these materials according to the different models proposed in the literature and in relation to the developed morphologies. In order to favour an individual dispersion of the silicate sheets at low filler contents, polyamide 6 and organo-modified montmorillonites are chosen as matrix and clay, respectively. Indeed, it has been already shown that exfoliated structures could be preferentially obtained in polar matrices due to favourable interactions between the polymer chains and the organo-modified clays [14]. A detailed morphological charaterization of the films is carried out considering the montmorillonite dispersion and the matrix crystalline microstructure. Indeed, like silicate layers, crystalline lamellae are impermeable to small molecules and are then likely to induce tortuosity effects towards the diffusing molecules. A quantitative description of the montmorillonite particle dispersion is further provided according to previous work of Vermogen et al. [15], [16]. It allows in particular to determine the dimensions of the dispersed impermeable objects required for the use of the gas transport models. The barrier properties are studied for different diffusing molecules and the modelling results are discussed as a function of the nanocomposite membrane morphologies. It is shown that it is necessary to take into account the polydispersity of the filler sizes and the contribution of the surfactant layer bonded to the silicate impermeable nanoplatelets when large assembled tactoids are observed.

The experiments were performed with a TGA apparatus (TGA 2950-Dupont Instruments) from 30 to 500 °C at 10 °C / min under helium atmosphere. Clay dispersion was analysed at two scales (i) by transmission electron microscopy, TEM, and by wet scanning transmission electron microscopy, Wet STEM, in order to get information up to a few micron square area and (ii) by X-ray diffraction analysis, XRD, in order to get d-spacing, d0 0 1, between the platelets. For transmission electron microscopy observations, the films were embedded in an epoxy (Epofix) resin. As the montmorillonite particles tend to lie parallel to the film surface, the samples were cut (with an ultramicrotome Reichert S) in order to observe the particles on their edges. To obtain sections thin enough and to avoid distortions such as thickness ripples, the surface of the pyramid was roughly set to 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm and a 35 ° diamond knife was used. Ultramicrotomed slices of 30 nm thick were prepared at room temperature with a knife speed set to 1 mm / s. Finally, the sections were mounted on a 400 mesh copper grid. The TEM bright field observations were performed on a Jeol-200CX microscope operating at 200 kV. Scanning transmission electron microscopy allowing transmission observation of wet samples in an environmental scanning electron microscopy was further performed on an aqueous solution of OMMT and on calcined clay compound according to the method described by Bogner et al. [18]. The diffraction patterns were obtained at room temperature in the range of 2θ between 1.5 ° and 9 ° by step of 0.02 ° using a Cu tube and a Siemens D500 diffractometer where the Kβ line was removed with a nickel filter. The films were deposited on neutral monosubstrates with a thin transfer adhesive with low scattering response. Measurements were carried out during two hours to minimize the background noise. The polymer crystalline structure was studied by wide angle X-ray diffraction experiments and differential scanning calorimetry. DSC data were obtained on 10 mg samples under helium atmosphere using a DSC2020 apparatus from TA Instruments. Two scans from 30 to 260 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C / min were successively recorded with an intermediate cooling at 10 °C / min. At the end of the first scan, the sample was held at 260 °C for 5 min before cooling to erase the sample thermal history. Precision on the enthalpy values was estimated to be better than 4% . The previously described XRD experiments were extended to the 2θ range from 12 ° to 30 ° to study the matrix crystalline structure. The transport properties of small molecules through nanocomposite films were studied according to different methods depending on the diffusing molecule. For helium and hydrogen, the gas permeation cell consisted of two compartments separated by the studied membrane (effective area 3 cm^2). The temperature of the cell was set at 20±1 °C. A preliminary high vacuum desorption was realized during at least 48 h to ensure that the static vacuum pressure changes in the downstream compartment were smaller than the pressure changes due to the gas diffusion. The gases were introduced in the upstream compartment under a pressure of 3 × 10^5 Pa (3 bar). The pressure variations in the downstream compartment were recorded as a function of time with a Datametrics pressure sensor. A steady-state line was obtained after a transitory state. The permeability coefficient expressed in barrer units (1 barrer = 10^-10 cm^3STP cm cm^-2 s^-1 cmHg^-1) was calculated from the slope of the steady-state line. A MOCON Oxtran oxygen permeability tester was used to measure the oxygen permeability at 30 °C. The studied film, which effective area was equal to 5 cm^2 was placed between the two halves of the permeability chamber and the rig was flushed with a nitrogen / hydrogen mixture at a flow rate of approximately 10 ml min^-1 to completely remove traces of oxygen. The apparent oxygen transmission rate under nitrogen was measured to give information on the background count due to leaks in the system. The gas flow in the upper half of the cell was then switched over to oxygen and the sample left to equilibrate. The oxygen transmission rate was determined in the steady state and it was expressed in cm^3 m^-2 day^-1. As the film thickness was equal for all the samples, it was possible to directly discuss the evolution of the oxygen transmission rate as a function of the nanocomposite composition. A gravimetric method was used to determine the water permeability. The measuring cell was filled with distilled water, covered with the film to be tested and sealed with a ring in order to obtain an effective film area of 3 cm^2. The cell was placed in a conditioned room (22 °C-30% RH) and turned upside down to allow the water to permeate through the film in controlled conditions. The weight loss was then plotted as a function of time. A steady-state line was obtained after a transitory state.

The values given in Table 1 are computed from at least five independent tests. They were corrected with respect to the loss of structural water and to the surfactant content of the clays. The measured inorganic weight fractions of the nanocomposites are 6.0, 9.7 and 12.5% , respectively. Thus, according to the abbreviation adopted in the experimental part, the nanocomposites will be denoted PANC6, PANC10 and PANC13, respectively. The X-ray diffraction curves of OMMT and PA6-OMMT nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 2 for the 2θ range from 1.5 ° to 9 °. The WAXS pattern relative to pristine OMMT displays a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 5 ° corresponding to a basal spacing, d0 0 1, of 18 Å. This peak is no more observed on the X-ray diffraction curves of PANC6 and PANC10 nanocomposites. For these contents of OMMT, the silicate platelets seem to be well exfoliated in the PA matrix. For nanocomposites based on a higher content, i.e. PANC13, the diffraction peak at 2θ = 5 ° is again clearly observed in addition to a small shoulder at 2θ = 2 ° (d0 0 1 = 44 Å). These results suggest that exfoliation is not complete in this system and that two populations of non-exfoliated clays co-exist: the first one is based on OMMTs that are not intercalated by the polymer chains exhibiting thus the same d-spacing than pristine OMMT and the second one is associated with intercalated structures as proved by the increase of the d-spacing values. The evolution of the silicate layers dispersion in the PA matrix as a function of the clay content is in agreement with some data reported in the literature [19], [20] and it is confirmed by TEM analysis (Fig. 3). A detailed morphological analysis of the nanocomposites has been carried out using TEM micrographs, according to the method recently proposed by Vermogen et al. [15], [16]. This method allows, by the analysis at different scales of the micrographs relative to the same nanocomposite, to provide a quantitative description of the montmorillonite particle dispersion in the polymer matrix. The details concerning the methodology and its validity were presented in previous papers [15], [16]. Only data that are relevant for the transport phenomenon understanding were reported in this study. In order to compare the nanocomposite morphologies, six classes of dispersed tactoids, i.e. objects based on the assembling of nanoclay platelets, were defined according to their thickness from individual exfoliated sheets to micron size agglomerates. The fraction (f) of each of these classes was determined considering a population of at least 300 dispersed objects (Table 2). A mean thickness, t, was computed for each class. A mean length, w, was also determined. Thus it was possible to calculate an average aspect ratio, α=w / t, for each class of dispersed objects and at last a mean aspect ratio, denoted αexp, characteristic of each nanocomposite. The amount of micron-size and middle-size agglomerates have been found to be very low in PANC6 and PANC10 nanocomposites (Table 2). Even if little amount of individual exfoliated sheets have been counted in the analysis, most of the tactoids do not contain more than five sheets. A good dispersion is then achieved up to 10 wt.% of inorganic amount. At higher loading, i.e. for PANC13, the number of intermediate-size tactoids and middle size agglomerates is found to be more important. This result is consistent with the X-rays diffraction analyses which have shown the existence of non-intercalated clays at high clay contents. Moreover, in a former study [15], [16] it has been shown that contrary to the particle thickness, the particle lengths were inappropriately estimated by TEM observations of ultramicrotomed samples. Indeed, measured particle length smaller than the expected ones have been correlated to TEM sample preparation (ultramicrotomy) and also to TEM projection effects because of the wavy shape of the particles. Thus, in order to be able to use accurate data in the modelling part of this work two-particle dimensions have been selected for discussion. First, Wet STEM has revealed to be an efficient technique to observe hydrated and non-hydrated particle shape and dimensions [18]. Wet STEM observations were performed over face-on particles, most of the time agglomerated in stacks (thickness >10 nm). Observations of an aqueous solution of the original clay (Nanofil 804 before introduction in the nanocomposite) and of the calcined clay compound PANC13 were carried out [15], [16]. The same particle length, e.g. 340 nm, was determined on the two samples. This value will then be considered for the following tactoid classes: micron size agglomerate, middle size tactoids, and 5-10 sheets tactoids. Second, as far as the individual sheet particles are concerned, similar measurements have been performed by TEM on the pristine clay and on the calcined PANC13 nanocomposite [15], [16]. Only face-on particles with the thinnest thickness have been taken into account for the measurements. Likewise in the Wet STEM observations, no particle length distribution difference was observed before and after the melt compounding. A mean particle length of 88 nm was evaluated and will be used as mean length for the clay tactoids that are composed of less than five sheets. Table 2 sums up the appropriate aspect ratios used for the modelling. It can be observed that these ones are low in comparison with the theoretical aspect ratio expected for a single silicate sheet. Nevertheless, whatever the nanocomposite composition, the platelets tend to lie parallel to the film surface (Fig. 3). "

239,Barrier properties of nylon 6-montmorillonite nanocomposite membranes prepared by melt blending Influence of the clay content and dispersion state Consequences on modelling.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Crystalline structure of the polyamide matrix']"," Crystalline lamellae are considered to be impermeable to small molecules. It is thus important to take into account any crystalline change in the polymer matrix in presence of clays in order to understand the evolution of the gas transport phenomenon. The crystallinity of the nanocomposite matrix has been studied considering the different crystalline phases of the polyamide. Indeed it is well known [21] that PA6 can exhibit two major crystalline phases: α and γ phases. The α phase has a monoclinic structure and hydrogen bonds are formed between antiparallel chains. The γ phase is also monoclinic but the latter can be represented as pseudo hexagonal lattice. In this case, the twisted chains allow hydrogen bonds to be formed between parallel chains. It has been shown that PA6 crystalline structure depends on crystallization conditions [21], i.e. the processing conditions [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. In general, fast cooling and low temperature of crystallization promote the γ form of nylon 6 while higher crystallization temperatures or slow cooling lead to the α form [21]. As a consequence, PA films obtained by hot pressing generally exhibit crystalline α phase [22], [23], [24], [25] whereas the crystalline structure of samples obtained by other processing modes such as injection or film blowing is more complex and generally results from the coexistence of α and γ phases [21], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. If the film process can have a significant effect on the PA6 crystalline structure, the introduction of silicate sheets into the polyamide matrix is also likely to change the crystalline characteristics of the polymer. It is generally assumed that the layered silicates can promote the growth of the γ-form crystals, as observed on films obtained by hot pressing. Indeed these films exhibit α phase for neat PA6 that turns into γ-form ones as far as fillers are introduced [22], [23], [24], [25]. Furthermore the relative fraction of α and γ phases seems to be dependent on the layered silicate content as well as on the interfacial interaction between nylon 6 and the surface of the silicate layers [31]. According to Lincoln et al. [32], these two parameters result in different chain mobility that will infer on the crystallization behaviour. Thus, most of the studies agree with the role of the montmorillonites in the γ phase formation. Nevertheless, opposite evolutions of the whole crystallinity have been shown in the literature upon the addition of these fillers [21], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [32], [33], [34]. Some studies [27], [28] have reported that the cristallinity of the polyamide 6 matrix remains unchanged with the addition of montmorillonites even though the proportion of γ phase increases whereas the crystallinity has been found to decrease in some extruded or compression moulded samples [24]. In this study, the crystalline structures of the neat PA6 and the PA6-based nanocomposites were investigated by X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. Fig. 4 gives the XRD patterns of the blown PA6 and nanocomposites films in the 2θ range from 14 ° to 26 °. All curves show a major diffraction peak at angular position 21.5 °. This diffraction peak can be assigned to the composition of both (0 0 1) and (2 0 0) reflection of the PA6 γ-form crystals [35]. Two small diffraction peaks associated with the (2 0 0) and (0 0 2) reflections of the crystalline PA6 α-phase are also observed at 19.6 ° and 24.5 ° [35]. Thus, according to XRD results, it can be concluded that both α and γ phases coexist in the neat PA6 and nanocomposites films. The presence of γ crystalline phase probably results from the rapid cooling induced by the film blowing process. DSC data were used to complete this qualitative analysis and to determine the whole crystallinity value and the relative proportion of each crystalline phase in the different films. Fig. 5a shows the first DSC scan of the neat PA6 and nanocomposites films. Two endothermic peaks are observed: the first one (T = 209 °C) is associated with the melting of the γ-form crystals of PA6 whereas the second one (T = 219 °C) is related to the melting of α-form crystals of PA6. In addition to these two endothermic peaks, a slight exothermic peak is observed at 190 °C. This peak could be attributed to an incomplete crystallization of the films during the film blowing process. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that this peak is no more observed in the second DSC scan of the films, as the initial thermo-mechanical history was erased and the cooling rate before this second heating run is low (Fig. 5b). Thus, the crystallinity index was calculated for each film by subtracting the enthalpy associated to the exothermic peak to the enthalpy relative to the total endotherm. The resulting enthalpy value was then normalized to the amount of PA and the crystallinity was calculated taking a value of ΔHf∞ = 190 J / g [34]. The crystallinity of the neat PA6 film is equal to 29.5% and the crystallinity values determined on the nanocomposite films remain in the same range (see Table 1). Thus, the crystallinity does not change with increasing the amounts of nanofillers in the PA matrix. The relative proportion of γ phase was also estimated from the DSC thermograms. It was calculated by the ratio between the area of the γ melting peak and the total melting peak surface. The results are presented in Fig. 6 and Table 1. It should be mentioned that due to the possible transformation of a part of γ-form crystals into α-form ones during the DSC heating, the real amounts of γ-phase are probably a little higher than those given in Fig. 6. Nevertheless, this should not modify the general evolution of the γ-phase proportion as a function of the clay content, namely a small increase of γ-phase amount as the filler loading increases (indeed these variations remain less than 10% ). As a conclusion, the introduction of lamellar nanofillers in polyamide matrix slightly enhances γ-phase formation in the films obtained by blowing extrusion but does not lead to major modifications in the whole crystallinity index. As a consequence, the changes in the gas permeation properties will only be related and discussed as a function of the parameters which quantify nanofillers dispersion. "

243,Barrier properties of nylon 6-montmorillonite nanocomposite membranes prepared by melt blending Influence of the clay content and dispersion state Consequences on modelling.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Gas permeation properties', 'Background']"," The gas permeation in an homogeneous pure polymer matrix is governed by a diffusion / solubility mechanism [36]. The diffusion coefficient (D) describes the kinetic aspect of the transport whereas the solubility coefficient (S) reflects the penetrant / polymer affinity and the thermodynamic aspect of the transport. In the case of a fickian transport, the permeability coefficient (P) can be expressed by the following law:(1)P=DSwhere P represents the volumetric gas flow rate going, in steady-state conditions, through a defined membrane area submitted to a fixed pressure gradient and normalized on membrane thickness. Eq. (1) has also been often considered to describe the gas transport properties of composites composed of impermeable fillers dispersed in a polymer matrix [3], [37]. If one assumes that the matrix local characteristics are not affected by the presence of particles and that the polymer / filler interactions are strong enough to avoid void creation at the interface, the gas solubility in the binary system can be expressed as:(2)S=(1-ϕ)S0where S0 is the solubility coefficient in the neat polymer, S the solubility coefficient in the nanocomposites, and, ϕ is the filler volume fraction. As far as the particles act as impermeable obstacles, the diffusing molecules have to follow a more tortuous path to go through the composite film. The diffusion rate is slow down and it can be expressed by Eq. (3):(3)D=D0τwhere D0 is the diffusion coefficient in the pure polymer, D the diffusion coefficient in the nanocomposites and τ is the tortuosity. Combining Eqs. (1), (2), (3) leads to the following expression of the relative permeability, i.e. the permeability of the nanocomposite ratioed to the permeability of the neat matrix:(4)PP0=1-ϕτwhere P0 is the permeability coefficient in the pure polymer and P is the permeability coefficient in the nanocomposites. Different models [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [38] have been proposed in the literature to describe the tortuosity and as a consequence the decrease of permeability induced by the dispersion of impermeable lamellar fillers in a polymer matrix. As the TEM analyses of the PA6 nanocomposites films showed that the long axis of the silicate layers were oriented parallel to the film surface, we will only consider in the following part of the paper, the models concerned with this optimal filler orientation. First, we focussed on models based on the dispersion of monodisperse impermeable objects [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Table 3 presents for each considered model, the geometry of the dispersed fillers, the type of dispersion that is taken into account and the expression of the tortuosity factor τ. Three geometries of impermeable fillers have been considered, i.e. ribbons, hexagonal flakes and disks, leading to different values of the aspect ratio, α, defined in Table 3. Nielsen’ model [6] assumes a regular array of ribbons of infinite length, of finite width, w, and thickness, t. According to Fredrickson and Bicerano [8], Nielsen’ model is accurate in the dilute regime but it is considered as inadequate by Cussler and co-workers [11] when the fillers concentration is semi-dilute, i.e. when the fillers concentration is low but the fillers overlap (ϕ ≪ 1 but αϕ ≫ 1). Thus new modelling have been recently proposed in order to take different types of array of the dispersed impermeable objects and also different shapes of these objects into account [11], [12]. In their modelling, Cussler and co-workers [9], [10], [11] consider two types of filler shapes (ribbons and hexagonal flakes) and different types of filler dispersion (from perfectly aligned to random dispersion). In all Cussler equations [9], [10], the factor αϕ is squared contrary to the Nielsen model. A geometric factor, μ, has also been introduced to take into account the shape, the regularity and the alignment of the fillers. However, the papers of this group include various versions of the predictive laws. We decided to consider equations that take into account the decrease of the solubility due to the presence of impermeable fillers. Additionally, the formulae presented in Table 3 differ by a factor 2 from original ones due to a slightly different definition of the aspect ratio α. It can also be observed from Table 3 that Cussler’ equation developed for a random array of ribbons slightly differs in this form from the other ones. Random dispersions of disks were considered by Fredrickson-Bicerano [8] and Gusev-Lusti [7] models respectively. In order to take into account the solubility decrease, Takahashi et al. [13] proposed to add the factor (1-ϕ) to the original polynomial formula from Fredrickson and Bicerano [8]. The equation proposed by Gusev and Lusti [7], i.e. an exponential function of αϕ, was obtained by finite element calculations. In that case also, we proposed to modify the initial equation with respect to the solubility effects. In addition to these models considering monodisperse fillers, we also considered Cussler-Lape’ model [11], which is a model based on polydisperse ribbons. Indeed, the morphological analysis of the PA6 based nanocomposites underlined a distribution in the size of the dispersed fillers. In Cussler-Lape’ model [11], the ribbon thickness, t, is supposed to be constant and a discrete distribution of the ribbon width, w, is considered. The relative permeability is given by the following equation:(5)PP0=1-ϕ1+(1 / 3(ϕ / (t∑iniwi))∑iniwi2)2 In the following part of this paper, the permeability results will be discussed as a function of the OMMT content and will be fitted by the different equations presented. Curve fitting efficiency was estimated from the classical coefficient R^2 and the residual sum of squares, RSS:RSS=∑(yexp-ycalc)2where yexp and ycalc are the reported experimental values and corresponding calculated values, respectively. The RSS value obtained from the regression of a given set of experimental data by different models allowed a direct and statistically significant comparison of the results obtained by the different fittings.

245,Barrier properties of nylon 6-montmorillonite nanocomposite membranes prepared by melt blending Influence of the clay content and dispersion state Consequences on modelling.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Gas permeation properties', 'Permeability results—modelling and discussion']"," Whatever the diffusing molecule, i.e. helium, dihydrogen, dioxygen or water, the nanocomposites have improved gas barrier properties in comparison with the neat PA6 film (Table 1). As revealed in Fig. 7, the relative permeability is significantly reduced by the addition of increasing amounts of organo-modified montmorillonites. Considering the uncertainty on the permeability values (∼5% ), it can be assumed that the relative permeability does not depend on the nature of the diffusing molecule and that a tortuosity effect is at the origin of the permeability decrease. Furthermore, the previous morphological analysis led to very similar mean aspect ratios of the dispersed fillers for all the nanocomposite films (see Table 2). Then, we could use the equations based on geometrical assumptions to fit the experimental permeability results and we considered in the first step of the modelling approach, the different equations developed for monodisperse impermeable flakes. For all models, it was necessary to determine at first and for each nanocomposite, the volume fraction of the impermeable phase, ϕ. ϕ was calculated according to the following conventional formula:(6)1ϕ=1+ρi(1-μi)ρpμiwith ρ the density, μ the weight fraction and the subscripts i and p referring to the impermeable and the permeable phases, respectively. The density value of the permeable phase was taken as equal to 1.13, i.e. the PA6 density value. We did not consider the contribution of the surfactant layer to the impermeable phase. Indeed most of the dispersed objects were composed of less than 5 silicate layers and the fraction of micron size agglomerates was very low (less than 1% ). The value of ρi was then taken as equal to 2.83 and μi was defined as the inorganic weight fraction determined by TGA. We determined for each model the theoretical mean aspect ratio, αcalc, that allowed the most accurate description of the experimental relative permeability curves (Table 4). The values of αcalc were also reported in Fig. 8, except for Cussler model with μ = 2 / 27 that led to extremely high and unrealistic αcalc values (values higher than 100, see Table 4). The straight line representative of the experimental mean aspect ratio, αexp, was added in the figure and the results were discussed according to two major considerations: (i) the ability of each model to describe the experimental relative permeability curves and (ii) the consistency of the calculated aspect ratios in comparison with the experimental values determined by the morphological analysis. Concerning the first aspect, whatever the model, the calculated aspect ratios depend in some extent on the diffusing molecule (Fig. 8). As shown in Table 4, the variation of the aspect ratio around a mean calculated value (αcalc¯) is quite consistent with the experimental variation of the relative permeability values for Cussler’ models (in the range of 15% -20% ) but it is very important (around 40% ) for Fredrickson-Bicerano’ model. It is also noticed that Nielsen and Gusev-Lusti’ models give similar results. This observation was also reported in the literature [13]. As the modelling concerns low αϕ values, the tortuosity factor defined in the Gusev-Lusti’ equation can be approximated by its first order limited development in the vicinity of 0 leading to a linear function of αϕ (Eq. (7)), as in Nielsen equation(7)exp⁡αϕ3.470.71≈1+0.71αϕ3.47 At last, all the models from Cussler’ type offer the best accuracy to describe the experimental relative permeability curves. Indeed the correlation coefficients obtained for these models are higher than those obtained for the other ones (Table 4). Thus, from this first analysis of the modelling data, it seems that Cussler’ models are the most appropriate to describe the transport properties of the PA based nanocomposites films. Concerning now the second discussion aspect, i.e. the comparison between the theoretical and the experimental aspect ratios, we can observe that, except for the model developed by Cussler et al. considering a random array of ribbons, all the other models tend to significantly overestimate the calculated aspect ratios in comparison with the experimental ones. These results seem to be quite consistent with the TEM images of the nanocomposites. Indeed, even if the impermeable flakes are parallel to the film surface, their alignment cannot be considered as perfect. Nevertheless, Cussler model based on a random array of ribbons still slightly overestimates the aspect ratio and does not take account of the polydispersity of the flakes aspect ratios evidenced by the detailed morphological analysis. We used then Cussler-Lape’ model [10] that considers the same kind of ribbons dispersion, a constant ribbon thickness, t, but different ribbons widths, wi. For each nanocomposite, the ribbons thickness, t, was taken as equal to the mean thickness calculated from the different tactoids classes defined in the morphological analysis. According to the same morphological analysis, two values of wi were considered: wi = 88 nm for tactoids with less than five sheets and wi = 340 nm for micron size agglomerate, middle size tactoids and 5-10 sheets tactoids. The calculated relative permeability curves presented in Fig. 9a and b for He and H2, respectively, show that the calculated values at high loading; i.e. for PANC13 greatly differs from the experimental ones. These values are even higher than that obtained for PANC10. This result is attributed to the slightly different filler dispersion state observed on PANC13 in comparison with PANC6 and PANC10. Indeed, even if micron size agglomerates amounts are less than 1% in all the nanocomposites, the fraction of middle size tactoids have been found to be significantly higher in PANC13 in comparison with PANC10 and PANC6 (Table 2). Thanks to the complete description of the filler geometrical characteristics of the different nanocomposites, we slightly modified Cussler-Lape’ model by considering the real thickness of the tactoids and then the distribution of the aspect ratio values. The following equation was proposed:(8)PP0=1-ϕ1+(1 / 3)ϕ / ∑ini(wi / ti)∑ini(wi / ti)22 The curves relative to Eq. (8) show a better agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 9a and b). However, a slight discrepancy remains at high fillers loading where the equation still underestimates barrier properties. This result is explained by an inappropriate estimation of the impermeable phase volume fraction in PANC13 for which a significant amount of middle size agglomerates is observed. Indeed, the surfactant represents 30 wt.% of the filler. For middle size and micron size agglomerates we can consider that the surfactant is trapped between the nanoplatelets leading to a higher impermeable volume than that obtained for well exfoliated nanoplatelet sheets (Fig. 10). We considered then two different values of the density as a function of the tactoid size. The density value was kept equal to 2.83 for tactoids with less than 10 silicate sheets. We used the classical equation developed for two-phases systems to calculate the density value for middle size and micron size agglomerates considering the contribution of both the surfactant layer and the inorganic layer. This density value was equal to 1.83. The total impermeable volume fraction was then determined and reported in Eq. (8). As shown in Fig. 9, these new assumptions do not significantly modify the relative permeability calculated for PANC6 and PANC10 but they allow a more accurate description of the experimental results at high MMT content. It was then posible to model by the proposed approach, the barrier properties of nanocomposites with different filler dispersions, thus to describe the transport behaviour of nanocomposites for a wide range of composition.

251,Barrier properties of nylon 6-montmorillonite nanocomposite membranes prepared by melt blending Influence of the clay content and dispersion state Consequences on modelling.xml,['Conclusions']," Polyamide 6-montmorillonites films have been studied for a wide range of clay content (from 0 to 18 wt.% ). As shown by WAXS and TEM analyses, a good nanofiller dispersion was achieved for all films and a quantitative description of the morphology was provided for each nanocomposite. At low filler loading, i.e. less than 10 wt.% of inorganic amount, majority of the dispersed tactoids did not contain more than 5 nanoplatelet sheets. At higher loading, the number of middle size agglomerates (stacks of more than 10 nanoplatelet sheets) increased to about 21% . Despite this difference, it appeared that the mean filler aspect ratios, were similar, about 20, whatever the clay content in the nanocomposite. This value was low in comparison with the aspect ratio generally considered for an individual silicate sheet. Moreover, according to the film processing, i.e. film blowing, all the silicate layers lied in the plane of the film, corresponding to the optimal orientation for increased barrier properties. XRD and DSC analyses allowed the quantitative description of the crystalline structure of the polymer matrix in the neat PA and the nanocomposite films. All the films contained both α and γ phase and introducing increasing amounts of fillers in the PA matrix slightly enhanced γ phase formation. However, it appeared that the presence of clay did not modify the whole crystallinity. As a consequence, the variations of the permeability coefficient were only related to the amount, size and dispersion state of fillers. Nanocomposites exhibited superior barrier properties to helium, dihydrogen, dioxygen, and water in comparison with neat PA film. Different models were used to describe the experimental relative permeability decrease. As the mean impermeable flakes aspect ratio did not seem to depend on the nanocomposite composition, i.e. the nanofiller content, models based on monodisperse fillers were used first. Cussler’ model based on random dispersion of ribbons seemed to be the most appropriate to describe the nanocomposites behaviour. Nevertheless, all these models generally overestimated the value of the aspect ratio necessary to fit the experimental curves. The possible factors at the origin of this discrepancy, such as the polydispersity of the flakes aspect ratios, were discussed. Cussler-Lape’ model, based on a constant filler thickness but on a distribution of the fillers widths was applied to our systems. Unfortunately, this model did not allow the accurate description of the nanocomposites properties at high montmorillonite content. Thanks to the complete description of the filler geometrical characteristics for the nanocomposites, we modified Cussler-Lape’ model to take into account the distribution of the tactoids thickness values and also the contribution of the surfactant layer to the impermeable phase volume fraction for the larger agglomerates. The experimental permeability decrease was then accurately described by the proposed equation in all the range of clay content. Thus, more generally, the results presented in this work suggested that the conventional models based on monodisperse fillers were relevant in well exfoliated nanocomposites in agreement with the original assumption made by the different authors, i.e. the use of these models in dilute or semi-dilute regimes. The models tended to become less accurate as a distribution of the aspect ratios was observed and as the amount of higher size agglomerates became more important. This generally occured at higher filler contents. Models based on polydisperse fillers became then more appropriate to describe the decrease of relative permeability, since they enhanced the effects of larger agglomerates. Nevertheless it seemed important to consider in these models not only the polydispersity of filler width but also the polydispersity of filler thickness and to take account of the contribution of the surfactant layer to the impermeable phase when large agglomerates were observed. The Cussler-Lape’ equation was modified according to these assumptions and the modified equation allowed an accurate description of the nanocomposites transport properties in a wide range of filler content.

252,Blown films of nanocomposites prepared from low density polyethylene and a sodium ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid).xml,['abstract']," A detailed study of the performance of blown films prepared from nanocomposites based on LDPE and a sodium ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) is reported. The organoclay content and film blowing conditions were varied to determine the effect of platelet concentration, exfoliation and orientation on film properties. Mechanical properties including stiffness, puncture resistance, and resistance to tear propagation were evaluated and compared to corresponding properties of unfilled polymer films. Permeability of the films to moisture and common atmospheric gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide was also measured using standard testing methods. In general, films prepared from nanocomposites based on the ionomer exhibited greater improvements in mechanical and barrier properties over unfilled polymer compared to similar films prepared from nanocomposites based on LDPE. This is due to the greater degree of organoclay exfoliation achieved in the ionomer compared to LDPE. The addition of 3 wt% MMT to the ionomer increased the tensile modulus of blown films by an average of 50% without sacrificing much tear strength, puncture resistance or film extensibility. Gas permeability in these films was lowered by 40% and moisture transmission rate was reduced by 60% . "

256,Blown films of nanocomposites prepared from low density polyethylene and a sodium ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid).xml,['Introduction']," Polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites prepared from the organically modified clay mineral montmorillonite (MMT) are of increasing interest for packaging applications [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. These composites offer the promise of improved mechanical and barrier properties over those of the matrix polymer owing to the nanoscale reinforcement and the tortuous diffusion path caused by dispersing the 1 nm thick, high aspect ratio aluminosilicate (clay) layers. In order to maximize these benefits it is necessary to attain high levels of organoclay exfoliation accompanied by a uniform distribution and proper orientation of the clay platelets. The formation of such nanocomposites from widely used, low-cost packaging polymers like low density polyethylene (LDPE) is of specific interest. Unfortunately, LDPE is highly inefficient at exfoliating the organoclays, since there is no favorable interaction with the polar surface of the clay [9], [10], [11]. While complete exfoliation of the organoclay in LDPE seems impossible, it is possible to improve the level of filler dispersion by carefully engineering the structure of the surfactant (surface treatment) used for preparing the organoclay [10], [11]. In contrast, ionomers, prepared by copolymerizing LDPE with small amounts of methacrylic acid (∼5 mol% ) followed by neutralization of some of the acid groups by metal bases [12], do a much better job of exfoliating these organoclays [10], [13], [14]. This has been attributed to the interactions of the ionic and acid groups in these polymers with the aluminosilicate surface of the clay. Such ionomers are widely used in a variety of packaging applications because of their clarity, barrier properties, high hot tack strength, low sealing temperatures, high clarity, and good formability [15]. In this study, we have evaluated the physical and barrier properties of blown films of nanocomposites prepared by melt mixing a suitable organoclay with LDPE and a sodium ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid). The selection of these two polymers, thus, allows us a comparison of two systems that exhibit quite different levels of exfoliation. The choice of the film preparation method (film blowing as opposed to casting, compression molding, etc.) was dictated by the possibility of greater biaxial orientation of the platelets / agglomerates in films made by this process. The organoclay structure and melt processing conditions were optimized to form nanocomposites with acceptable levels of exfoliation. Films with thicknesses of 1 mil, 2 mil, and 3 mil were prepared by varying the draw down ratio at two different blow-up ratios to determine the effect of platelet concentration, exfoliation, and orientation on film performance. Mechanical properties including stiffness, puncture resistance, and resistance to tear propagation were evaluated and compared to corresponding properties of unfilled polymer films. Permeability of the films to moisture and common atmospheric gases like oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide was also measured using standard testing methods. "
257,Blown films of nanocomposites prepared from low density polyethylene and a sodium ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid).xml,['Experimental']," A commercially available grade of LDPE, Novapol LF-0219A, and a sodium ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid), Surlyn^® 8945 were used in this study. Selected properties of these materials are included in Table 1. The melting point and heat of fusion of the polymers were determined using DSC analysis, while, their crystallinity was calculated by dividing the respective heats of fusion by the heat of fusion for 100% crystalline polyethylene, 293 J / g [16]. DSC analyses were made with a Perkin Elmer DSC 7 using 10 mg of polymer excised from pellets. All samples were initially heated to 180 °C at 40 °C / min, held at that temperature for 5 min, and subsequently cooled to 0 °C at 5 °C / min. After holding at 0 °C for 3 min, the samples were reheated to 180 °C at 20 °C / min. The values reported in Table 1 were recorded on the second heating. The organically modified clay, designated here as M2(HT)2-140, was supplied by Southern Clay Products and was used as received. It was prepared by a cation exchange reaction between sodium montmorillonite and a two-tailed quaternary ammonium surfactant, dimethyl bis(hydrogenated-tallow) ammonium chloride (Arquad 2HT-75). The suffix 140 represents the MER loading level of the organoclay (see Table 1 for details), i.e., the clay is over-exchanged and the excess amine is within the galleries of the as-received organoclay. The choice of the organoclay was based upon recent studies exploring the effect of the surfactant structure on organoclay exfoliation in polyethylene [9], [10], [11] and the selected sodium ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) [13]. These studies revealed that higher levels of organoclay exfoliation could be achieved using surfactants with multiple alkyl tails on the ammonium ion rather than one tail and by using organoclays with excess surfactant rather than stoichiometric loading. This is believed to be the result of the better affinity these polymers have for the largely aliphatic organic modifier than for the pristine surface of the clay. In addition, the larger the number of alkyl tails, or larger the amount of surfactant, the more the silicate surface is shielded from the matrix; this combination of factors leads to better exfoliation of the organoclay. The polymers and the organoclay were melt mixed in a Werner-Pfleiderer ZSK25 twin screw co-rotating extruder (D = 25 mm, L / D = 48) at 190 °C, using a feed rate of 40 lb / h to form nanocomposites with 1 and 3 wt% MMT. The filler and the matrix were added to the extruder using two separate feed-ports. Polymer was fed using an upstream port while the clay was added to the molten polymer using a downstream port. Prior experience [17], [18] has revealed better organoclay exfoliation in nanocomposites formed using such a feeding system, rather than feeding the clay and the polymer together in the upstream region of the extruder, which mainly consists of kneading blocks. Blown films were prepared from the polymers and their nanocomposites at 190 °C using a 38 mm Davis Standard extruder fitted with a 10.16 cm Sano Spiral-Mandrel film die and a dual lip-air ring, at two different blow-up ratios (BUR), 2:1 and 3:1. The draw down ratio (DDR) was varied to form films with 1 mil, 2 mil, and 3 mil thicknesses, respectively (1 mil = 25.4 μm). BUR, a term commonly used in describing the processing conditions for blown films, is the ratio of the diameter of the final film ‘tube’ to the diameter of the die. DDR, another such term, is the ratio of the final film velocity, i.e., the velocity at the nip roll, to the initial polymer velocity, i.e., the average polymer velocity at the die exit. DDR and BUR are correlated by a simple mathematical equation: DDR = (Die gap) / [(film thickness) × (BUR)]. In all, 35 films were blown; it was not possible to blow film from the unfilled ionomer at one condition (3:1 BUR and 7 DDR) as bubble stability could not be maintained. Puncture resistance (dart impact strength), tensile properties, and resistance to tear propagation of the nanocomposite films in the machine direction (MD) and transverse direction (TD) were evaluated as per ASTM standards D1709, D882, and D1922, respectively, and the properties were compared to those of the corresponding unfilled polymer films. Permeability of the films to O2, N2 and CO2 gases were determined at 35 °C using a constant-volume-variable pressure method as described by Koros et al. [19]. The thickness of each film sample used for permeability measurements was confirmed using a micrometer screw. Moisture permeability of the films was determined as per ASTM standard F1249. Melt rheological measurements of the nanocomposites were made using an ARES torsional rheometer operated in an oscillatory mode at 190 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Compression molded disks (∼1.8-2.0 mm) were placed between the parallel plates of the rheometer. Once thermal equilibrium was achieved, the disks were squeezed between the parallel plates to 1.6 mm thickness, and the excess material was trimmed prior to the frequency sweep test. "

For both polymers, at low frequencies, the melt viscosity increases systematically with increasing clay content. This is consistent with the previous studies examining the rheological behavior of polymer clay nanocomposites [20], [21], [22], [23]. It is interesting to note that the magnitude of viscosity enhancement for the ionomer based nanocomposites is much greater than for the LDPE based nanocomposites. This is attributable to higher level of organoclay exfoliation in the ionomer based nanocomposites compared to the LDPE based nanocomposites as discussed earlier. In particular, the ionomer nanocomposite with 3 wt% MMT does not reveal a Newtonian plateau (at low shear rates) evident for the pure ionomer and for the nanocomposite containing 1 wt% MMT. This is consistent with the rheological signature for the formation of a network of clay platelets within the ionomer matrix. "

As expected, samples prepared from the unfilled polymers were colorless, while those prepared from the nanocomposites had a yellowish tinge. All samples had a smooth texture, which was a significant improvement over previous trials when the samples had rough, sand-paper like texture [24]. This could be attributed to the acceptable levels of organoclay exfoliation achieved in these nanocomposites resulting from the use of an appropriate organoclay and optimum processing conditions. The clarity of the films was slightly compromised by the addition of organoclay. As shown in Fig. 2, the haze increases steadily with an increase in the clay content. All of the films produced, including those with the organoclay, contained very few visual imperfections such as gels or fisheyes. "

Similar data for blown films prepared from the Surlyn^® ionomer are presented in Fig. 4. As expected [9], [10], [13], for both polymers, tensile modulus increases as the organoclay content increases. It is important to note that the modulus enhancement is significant along both the MD and TD of the blown films. The increase in modulus of the films prepared from the ionomer based nanocomposites is significantly higher than that of the LDPE based nanocomposites. This is a result of better organoclay exfoliation in the ionomer than in LDPE as described earlier. A numerical comparison between the improvements in modulus exhibited by the nanocomposite films (containing 3 wt% MMT) prepared from LDPE and the ionomer relative to the corresponding films prepared from the unfilled polymer is presented in Table 3. A comparison between Fig. 3(a) and (b) indicates that blown films prepared from unfilled LDPE have a higher tensile modulus along the transverse direction than along the machine direction. On the other hand, such trends are not evident in films prepared from the ionomer (Fig. 4). These results could be attributed to differences in crystallinity between the two polymers and orientation of the lamellae in these films. LDPE is considerably more crystalline than the ionomer (see Table 1); the bulky methacrylic acid groups of the ionomer interfere with the chain folding process, which subsequently results in a lower crystallinity and smaller crystallites compared to the base polyethylene. Thus, the ionomer has better optical properties, viz., haze, gloss, and clarity, than LDPE. Crystallization in a blown film process occurs under the influence of an external strain which generally results in an oriented morphology, with the long axes of the crystalline lamellae generally oriented perpendicular to the film MD. For polymers such as LDPE, the unit cell ‘a’ axis is oriented preferentially along the film MD, and such a microstructure is well described by the Keller-Machin ‘row’ structure [25], [26], [27]. The orientation of the lamellar long axes perpendicular to the film MD causes the TD modulus to be higher than the MD modulus [28]. On the other hand, for nanocomposites prepared from the ionomer, tensile modulus is slightly higher in the MD than in the TD (opposite of nanocomposites based on LDPE). This is attributable to: (i) very low crystallinity in the ionomer films, and (ii) orientation of the clay platelets / tactoids in the plane of the film. The montmorillonite platelets are not perfectly circular, i.e., they have a major and a minor axis [29]. During the film blowing process, the major axis would tend to get aligned in the machine direction (more so at a lower BUR than at a higher BUR), and this would result in a higher modulus in the MD than the TD. In LDPE-organoclay composites, the level of organoclay exfoliation is not as great as that in the ionomer. As a result, the contribution of the orientation of the small aspect ratio filler particles towards the tensile modulus of the composite is more than negated by the contribution of the orientation of the crystal lamellae. On the other hand, in ionomer-organoclay nanocomposites, the polymer crystallinity is comparatively lower and the contribution of the orientation of the high aspect ratio clay particles dominates the tensile modulus values. Another trend seen in Fig. 3 is that for LDPE based films, modulus increases as the film thickness decreases (increasing draw down ratio). This is true for the unfilled polymer and the nanocomposites. Films prepared from the ionomer or its nanocomposites do not reveal this trend (Fig. 4). Once again, this could be attributed to the differences in crystallinity between the two polymers and the consequent influence of the orientation of the crystal lamellae. For LDPE, greater orientation of the crystallites in the plane of the film, resulting from the elongational flow-induced morphology generated during the film blowing process, improves as the film thickness decreases.

In most cases, the stress at break in the machine direction is greater than that in the transverse direction. The effects are more pronounced at a lower blow-up ratio, and for the 1 mil thick films. Generally, in LDPE blown films with the ‘row’ structure, the MD stress at break tends to be higher than that along the TD [28]. Because this relates to the preferential orientation of the lamellar long axes perpendicular to the film MD, the differential in the break stress along the MD and TD is greater at lower BUR and for thinner films.

Results for films prepared from LDPE and its nanocomposites are presented in Fig. 11. Similar data for blown films prepared from the Surlyn^® ionomer are presented in Fig. 12. One of the most noticeable observations is the difference between the tear strengths of the two polymers (and also their nanocomposites). The ionomer films display poor tear resistance relative to LDPE films. Although, it is not completely clear what could cause such a difference between the two systems, it could be a consequence of differences in crystallinity and orientation between the two polymers. For unfilled LDPE films, the tear resistance is always higher along the MD relative to TD. This difference is more magnified at 2:1 BUR than at 3:1 BUR. This is very likely due to the varying degrees of orientation of the lamellae within the plane of the film. Both MD and TD tear resistance values are higher at 2:1 BUR relative to 3:1 BUR. A deeper insight into the lamellar morphology is required to explain this observation. However, such an investigation is beyond the scope of this study. Nanocomposites prepared from LDPE exhibited similar trends as the unfilled polymer. As the clay content increases, MD tear decreases and TD tear increases. This effect is more dramatic at higher DDR (1 mil thick films) than at lower DDR. In contrast, tear resistance of films prepared from the ionomer and its nanocomposites seems fairly insensitive to the clay content. There is not much difference between the tear resistance in the machine direction and transverse direction for these films. "

A comparison between the gas permeabilities of the two unfilled polymer films (film #3 vs film #21, and film #6 vs film #24) shows that blown films prepared from the ionomer have better barrier properties than those prepared from LDPE. In general, for polymers that are chemically identical, gas permeability increases as polymer crystallinity decreases [31]. However, in the case of the ionomer, the effects of the polar methacrylic acid groups and the sodium ion clusters more than compensate for the decreased barrier resistance brought by the lower crystallinity of the polymer relative to LDPE. The permeability of the two polymers and their nanocomposites was much greater for CO2 than O2, which in turn was higher than the permeability of N2. The differences between the permeability to various gases stem from the differences in diffusivity and solubility of the gas molecules in the polymer matrix. The permeability coefficient (P) is the product of the diffusion coefficient, D, and the solubility coefficient, S, i.e., P = DS. Diffusivity is governed by the size (e.g., critical volume) of a gas molecule. N2 has a critical volume of 90 cm^3 / mol compared to 74 cm^3 / mol for O2 and 94 cm^3 / mol for CO2. There is not a large difference between the solubilities of N2 and O2 [32]. Hence, the films have a higher permeability to oxygen than nitrogen. On the other hand, although the CO2 molecule is larger than both oxygen and nitrogen, its solubility in the polymer membrane is significantly greater than that of the other two gases [32]. As a result, the polymer membranes have lower barrier resistance to CO2 than O2, and N2. Gas permeability decreases as the organoclay content increases in both polymers. The permeability coefficients of the nanocomposite films relative to the corresponding films without clay (P / P0) for the various gases in LDPE and the ionomer nanocomposite films are also included in Table 4 (in parentheses). For a given polymer, at fixed montmorillonite content, there is not a significant difference between the relative permeabilities of the three gases. Hence, as an example, the relative permeability of CO2 in LDPE and ionomer nanocomposite films is plotted as a function of the montmorillonite content in Fig. 13. At 1 wt% MMT, the relative permeabilities for the two polymer matrices are similar (within standard deviation). However, the nanocomposite film containing 3 wt% MMT prepared from Surlyn^® 8945 ionomer shows a larger reduction in permeability compared to the corresponding film prepared from LDPE. This could be attributed to the superior level of organoclay exfoliation achieved in the ionomer compared to LDPE. The effect of the draw down ratio on the barrier properties of blown films prepared from nanocomposites based on LDPE is shown in Fig. 14. It is clear that nanocomposite films with greater DDR have superior gas barrier properties (per unit thickness) compared to those with smaller DDR. This could be due to possible greater biaxial orientation of the clay platelets in the plane of the film during the preparation of thinner films (large DDR) compared to thicker films (small DDR). Also, it seems that changing the BUR from 2:1 to 3:1 does not affect the relative gas permeabilities of the nanocomposite films prepared from either LDPE or the ionomer. "

In this study, we compare the experimental gas permeation data to that predicted by the tortuous path model proposed by Nielsen which approximates the filler particles as platelets with finite width, w, and thickness, t, but infinite length [33]. The mathematical form of this model isPP0=(1-ϕ)(1+αϕ2)where α = particle aspect ratio = w / t and ϕ = volume fraction of the particles. Fig. 15 shows plots of the gas permeability coefficients for O2, N2, and CO2 in the 1 mil thick nanocomposite films relative to the corresponding value for films prepared from the pure polymers. The solid lines represent the relative permeability, P / P0, predicted for different particle aspect ratios by the Nielsen model. It is interesting to note that the aspect ratios of the particles in the ionomer and LDPE based nanocomposites determined using model calculations are significantly larger than those determined by the particle analysis technique (∼10-30) [10], [11], [42]. Such a discrepancy could be a result of the assumptions built into the permeability model [33], and the problems associated with the calculation of the particle aspect ratio from TEM micrographs [42]. In a previous study, Hotta and Paul [9] determined the relative permeability of nanocomposite films containing 2.5 wt% MMT prepared from linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) containing some maleated LLDPE as a compatibilizer to be ∼0.8. These films were prepared by compression molding and were 150 μm thick; hence, it would not be fair to make a direct comparison between the films evaluated in the two studies. Nevertheless, a comparison of their data with the Nielsen model suggested a filler aspect ratio of ∼60, which was also significantly larger than the aspect ratio of ∼10 determined by particle analysis of the TEM micrographs. (Note: due to a calculation error, which came to the authors' attention after the publication of the manuscript, the theoretical relative permeability curves based upon the Nielsen model presented in that paper are incorrect.)

The trends are similar to those observed for gas barrier properties, i.e., the reduction in WVTR with increasing montmorillonite content is greater for the ionomer film compared to the LDPE film. Once again, this could be attributed to the differences in the level of organoclay exfoliation of the two systems. It is noteworthy that although the level of organoclay exfoliation is relatively poor in LDPE [10], [11], the addition of 3 wt% MMT lowers the WVTR by as much as 45% . The improvement in moisture barrier properties of similar nanocomposite films prepared from the ionomer is ∼60% . The relative permeability values of the nanocomposite films for water vapor are somewhat different than those for the gases evaluated in the earlier section. Based upon the tortuous path model, there should not be any differences in the relative permeability for the gases and water vapor (assuming that the method used for testing does not have a significant bearing on the results). This is an interesting observation and should be a part of another broader investigation. "

289,Blown films of nanocomposites prepared from low density polyethylene and a sodium ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid).xml,['Conclusions']," Mechanical and barrier properties of blown films prepared from nanocomposites based on LDPE and a sodium ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) are presented here. The organoclay and processing conditions were carefully chosen to form nanocomposites with acceptable levels of exfoliation. Films prepared from the nanocomposites had a smooth texture and surface properties; however, the haze increased slightly with increasing MMT content. In general, films prepared from nanocomposites based on the ionomer exhibited greater improvements in mechanical and barrier properties over unfilled polymer compared to similar films prepared from nanocomposites based on LDPE. This is due to the higher levels of organoclay exfoliation achieved in the ionomer compared to LDPE. The tensile modulus of blown films based on the ionomer increased by an average of 50% without sacrificing tear strength, puncture resistance or film extensibility upon addition of 3 wt% MMT to the polymer. In contrast, the same amount of organoclay resulted in a 25% increase (average) in the modulus of LDPE films. Mechanical properties of films prepared from LDPE and its nanocomposites were more sensitive to processing conditions than those prepared from the ionomer and its nanocomposites. This is because LDPE is more crystalline than the ionomer, and the orientation of the crystal lamellae also plays a role (besides that played by the clay platelets) in the determination of the mechanical properties. The nanocomposites also offered significant improvements in barrier properties compared to the corresponding unfilled polymers. Gas permeability of ionomer films was lowered by as much as 40% and moisture transmission rate was lowered by 60% upon addition of 3 wt% MMT to the polymer. The improvements in barrier properties of LDPE based nanocomposite films were relatively smaller owing to lower levels of exfoliation. "

Nonrenewable based polymeric composites which are used extensively have created a lot of environmental problems. For last two decades more attention has been focused on renewable biobased composite materials, called as bio-hybrid materials (Dujardin and Mann, 2002, Ruiz-Hitzky et al., 2005). Recent developments on nanotechnology have contributed for the fabrication of bio-nanohybrid materials or bionanocomposites, by utilizing the interdisciplinary approach. These materials are of great interest due to their versatile applications in important areas as diverse as regenerative medicine and new materials with improved functional and structural properties (Darder et al., 2007, Fahmy, 2007, Fahmy and Mobarak, 2008a, Fahmy and Mobarak, 2008b, Fahmy and Mobarak, 2011a, Fahmy and Mobarak, 2011b, Fahmy et al., 2006). Nanobiocomposites represent an ecological alternative to conventional polymer nanocomposites, as the materials produced are environmentally friendly and renewable. Nanocomposites obtained from the combination of polysaccharides, such as starch, cellulose or polylactic acid (PLA) with nanoparticulated solids is also called as green nanocomposites or bioplastics (Pandey et al., 2005, Ray and Bousmina, 2005). The properties of nanobiocomposites obtained by assembling inorganic solids such as transition metals, carbon particles, metal oxides, metal hydroxides, silica, silicates, carbonates, phosphates and nitrides with biological species are of diverse nature. Cellulose which is an organic compound with formula (C6H10O5)n, is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand β (1→4) linked d-glucose units, is an almost inexhaustible biopolymer with outstanding properties (Klemm et al., 2005, Nishiyama et al., 2002, Updegraff, 1969). For many years it has been an important raw material used in the form of intact wood for construction purposes, natural textile fibers and papers. Cellulose derivatives have been used as optical films, coatings, controlled released systems, biodegradable plastics, biomedical materials and composites (Bledzki & Gassan, 1999). In recent years a lot of work has been devoted on nanocomposites having cellulose as a matrix with fillers such as SiO2 (Pinto, Marques, Barros-Timmons, Trindade, & Pascoal Neto, 2008), TiO2 (Sequeira, Evtugulin, Portugal, & Esculeas, 2007), gold (Pinto, Marques, Martins, Pascoal Neto, & Trinidade, 2007) and kaolin particles (Fahmy and Mobarak, 2008a, Fahmy and Mobarak, 2008b). All these composite materials show improved mechanical, optical and thermal properties due to the combination of organic and inorganic components in the final material. Vilela et al. (2010) synthesized and characterized cellulose / calcium carbonate nanocomposites and reported the improved mechanical properties as compared to virgin cellulose. Pranger and Tannenbaum (2008) prepared biobased nanocomposites of furfuryl alcohol with cellulose whisker and montmorillonite clay and reported their high thermal resistance. Cellulose acetate / organoclay nanocomposites were successfully prepared and studied their mechanical properties (Park, Mishra, Drzal, & Mohanty, 2004). Cerruti et al. (2008) prepared the cellulose / montmorillonite nanocomposites and investigated the increase in thermo-oxidative stability as compared to the cellulose. Boron nitride bears many specific novel properties, like high melting and decomposition temperature, thermal conductivity, high thermal stability, chemically inertness, oxidation resistance, limited surface activity, nonwettability and lubricating effect. It can be hot pressed, coated and intercalated to synthesize different composites, where it plays an important role. The composite materials made of boron nitride coating / mixing / incorporating have a lot of applications, such as raw material for super abrasives, cosmetic applications, in thermal management, functional coating in the automotive industry and releasing agent in glass industry (Kisku & Swain, 2012). The cooling effect of boron nitride in cosmetics was reported in the literature (Esposito, 2002). The boron nitride composites have also been suggested for high temperature applications (Eichler & Lesnaik, 2008). The addition of boron nitride to alumina and silicon nitride improved the thermal shock resistance of the materials (Trice & Halloran, 1999). Chen et al. (2009) reported the non-cytotoxicity of boron nitride to human beings. Further, a series of works on non biodegradable polymers such as polyaniline, polystyrene and copolymer of vinylidene chloride and acrylonitrile composites were performed with reinforcement of boron nitride, in which the role of BN was justified in terms of thermal, mechanical and optical properties (Zhi et al., 2005, Zhi et al., 2006). A lot of works on boron nitride filled materials were reported, however the investigation of thermal and chemical resistant cellulose composites with substantial reduction in gas permeation property was scanty in the literature. In the present study we investigated the formation of cellulose nanobiocomposites by solution method where boron nitride was intercalated with cellulose matrix. The dispersion of boron nitride and formation of nanobiocomposite has been evidenced by substantial reduction in oxygen permeability and appreciable improvement of thermal and chemical resistant property.

The addition of PEG 400 into the pure PLA film decreased the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the film. The BP-PLA and ABP-PLA film had around 51 °C of Tg while pure PLA film had 66 °C. Due to the decreased Tg of both the BP-PLA and ABP-PLA film, both films had an increased elongation at break (% E). The addition of plasticizer into the pure PLA film also caused increased water vapor permeability (WVP) and decreased oxygen permeability (OP). The ABP-PLA film had highest DPPH radical scavenging activity, 90% , while pure PLA and BP-PLA film had only 0 and 14% , respectively. "

321,"Characterization of an antioxidant polylactic acid (PLA) film prepared with Î±-tocopherol, BHT and polyethylene glycol using film cast extruder.xml",['Introduction']," One of the major functions of a food packaging material is to protect the food products from various physical, chemical, biological and environmental conditions, such as oxygen, moisture, light, microorganisms, and physical stress. In recent years, there has been an increased demand for packaging that offers an improved shelf life for fresh, high quality food products. Active packaging has been developed in response to these demands. Active packaging is defined as the packaging that changes the conditions of the packed food to extend shelf life, to improve sensory properties, or to inhibit the growth of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms (Ahvenainen, 2003). It involves the interactions between package and packaged food or headspace atmosphere by the incorporation of certain additives into packaging film or within packaging containers (Day, 2003). Antioxidant packaging is a major category of the active packaging and very promising technique for extending food product shelf life. Some forms of food deterioration, such as the development of off-flavor, color and flavor changes, and nutritional losses, are caused by oxidation (Anklam et al., 1997, Morales-Aizpurua and Tenuta-Filho, 2005). To prevent oxidation in food products, several synthetic or natural antioxidants have been incorporated into the packaging film structure as an antioxidant packaging (Botterweck et al., 2000, Chen et al., 1992, Hamilton et al., 1997). Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) are the most widely used synthetic antioxidants in the prevention of oxidation in food products. However, many consumers do not prefer these synthetic antioxidants due to their toxicity and suspected carcinogenic potential (Botterweck et al., 2000, Chen et al., 1992). From the safety and marketing point of view, a natural antioxidant is more attractive. α-tocopherol is a natural chain-breaking antioxidant with a positive consumer perception (Hamilton et al., 1997). In addition, it is very stable under conventional film processing conditions. α-tocopherol has been incorporated into polymer materials as a stabilizer (Al-Malaika et al., 1994, Al-Malaika et al., 1999) and as an antioxidant in controlled release packaging to reduce the oxidation of a fatty food simulant (Siro et al., 2006). Wessling et al., 1999, Wessling et al., 2000 have reported on the possibility of the antioxidant incorporation into the low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) as an active packaging material for various liquid food products and food simulants. Despite the fact that petroleum-based polymers are widely used in packaging industry, demand is increasing for alternative biodegradable polymers. Recently, fish and mammalian gelatin films containing natural antioxidants were developed by film casting method (Gimenez et al., 2009, Gomez-Estaca et al., 2009). However, biopolymer film production using a casting method is normally not feasible for commercial film production. This type of film casting is difficult to scale up and it incorporates several steps in order to produce an acceptable biopolymer film, which results in a relatively long processing time. Polylactic acid (PLA) is a very versatile compostable polymer derived from natural source. It is easily processed and exhibits good mechanical properties. Recently, antimicrobial PLA films were developed by solvent casting method (Mascheroni et al., 2010). In addition, PLA film can also be made by conventional film extrusion methodology. For this reasons, PLA is an excellent candidate for producing a commercial, compostable packaging material. One limitation of PLA is that it is fairly stiff at room temperature. Therefore, plasticizer is commonly added to promote flexibility (Kulinski and Piorkowska, 2005, Pillin et al., 2006, Thellen et al., 2005). Another major limitation of PLA relative to polyolefin is that it has poor gas barrier properties (Lehermeier et al., 2001). The objective of this study was to develop an α-tocopherol incorporated PLA film as a new antioxidant packaging material. BHT and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) were added to protect PLA film from degradation during extrusion and to improve the flexibility of PLA film, respectively. BHT is widely used as an antioxidant to protect film degradation during processing in packaging industry. The effect of plasticizer and α-tocopherol on barrier properties, thermal properties, mechanical properties, optical properties, and antioxidant activity of the PLA film were investigated. "

Pure PLA pellets contained 2.5 kg of PLA 4000 only, while BP-PLA pellets contained 2.5 kg of PLA 4000, 0.25 g of BHT, and 250 g of PEG 400. ABP-PLA pellets contained 2.5 kg of PLA 4000, 25 g of α-tocopherol, 0.25 g of BHT, and 250 g of PEG 400. All three PLA pellets were dried at 35 °C for 48 h before extrusion film casting. A single screw film casting extruder (Killion Extruders Div., Davis Standard Co., West Midlands, UK) equipped with 20 cm wide slit casting die was used to make films. The extruder was equipped with a single screw with D = 25 mm, L / D = 24:1, where D and L are diameter and length of the screw, respectively. The barrel had three heating zones and a 3 hp motor turning the screw. Film casting conditions was shown in Table 1. The temperatures of the three extruder heating zones were set at 149, 177, and 193 °C, respectively. The screw speed for the samples was 20 rpm. An adapter was installed ahead of the barrel and its temperature was set at 193 °C. Five heater cartridges, one thermocouple and one PLC controller were used to control the die temperature. The die temperature was fixed at 193 °C. The chill roll was placed in 2 cm from the die and its temperature was kept at 18 °C by temperature controller. The film was quenched by a chill roll and was transported to a pulling station using a nip roll. The speed of chill and nip rolls were controlled separately from the extruder using a dial and digital display. Finally, all extruded films were wound by an electric film winder at the speed of 7.2 fpm. All extruded films exhibited a homogeneous distribution of all components with no accumulation of plasticizer, BHT, and α-tocopherol at the film surface. Extrusion of pure PLA pellets showed the highest back pressure and resulted in a stiff and brittle film material. Film thickness was measured using digital micrometer and presented the average of three measurements. "

It was assumed that both the BP-PLA and ABP-PLA film had less free volume than the pure PLA film. As a result, both the BP-PLA and ABP-PLA film had lower OP than the pure PLA film. In addition, the BP-PLA film had a lower OP than the ABP-PLA film (Table 2). In related research, it was found that gelatin biopolymer films with lipid additions had increased OP. This was due to the hydrophobic nature of the lipid component facilitating the oxygen transfer (Bertan et al., 2005).

(1997) demonstrated water transport in PLA and PLA / PEG blends. The polymer blend of PEG and PLA behaves like a hydrophilic polymer. It has a high permeability coefficient due to the presence of hydrophilic groups in the PEG component of the blend. The BP-PLA film had higher WVP than the pure PLA film (Table 2).

It is well known that the addition of a plasticizer lowers the Tg of PLA polymers (Kulinski and Piorkowska, 2005, Pillin et al., 2006). On the thermograms of the BP-PLA film, two pronounced melting peaks appeared; smaller around 142 °C and larger around 151 °C. These results correlate with other research findings where an increase in plasticizer content resulted in smaller melting peaks and shifted them to a lower temperature (Kulinski and Piorkowska, 2005). Pillin et al. (2006) also demonstrated a decreased Tm of PLA films with various plasticizers. In addition, the Tc peaks were narrowed by addition of PEG 400 and also moved to lower temperature around 101 °C in this research.

351,Combined effects of cellulose nanocrystals and silver nanoparticles on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,['Introduction']," The research on bioactive films based on biodegradable polymers, such as polyesters, structural polysaccharides, gums, proteins, lipids and their complexes is currently improving to satisfy industrial requirements and consumer desires by maintaining food safety, and minimizing their environmental impact. In response to the consumer requirements for safer and environmentally friendly packaging materials, the combination of bio-based additives and functional nanostructures is one of the most promising alternatives to conventional plastics (Siracusa et al., 2008). Selection of bio-polymers for food packaging applications depends mainly on their functional properties, such as mechanical and barrier performance against oxygen, water vapour and light since these are factors with advert influence in food quality and shelf life (Turhan and Sahbaz, 2004). To date, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is the biopolymer with the highest potential for commercial major scale production of renewable packaging materials (Auras et al., 2004, Gandini, 2011, Lasprilla et al., 2012, Conn et al., 1995). In addition, nano-biocomposites represent a promising route for creating new and innovative materials, in particular by enhancing the ductile properties of some bio-polymers in those applications where flexibility would be an essential issue, such as films. The use of nanotechnologies in food packaging applications promises many stimulating changes to enhance health, wealth and quality of foodstuff, while reducing the environmental impact of the residues produced after use (Cushen et al., 2012). Nevertheless and despite first encouraging results, the road to successful nano-biocomposites with the adequate properties for food packaging is still long (Jiménez and Ruseckaite, 2012). Cellulose nanostructures have been recognized as possible bio-based additives to enhance the bio-polymers performance, in terms of mechanical, thermal and barrier properties as it was reported in previous studies (Fortunati et al., 2012a, Nassar and Youssef, 2012). Cellulose-based materials are widely used because of their biocompatibility, edibility, abundance in nature, excellent barrier properties and low cost (Vasconez et al., 2009). The use of nanocelluloses has been widely proposed to enhance PLA properties (Kowalczyk et al., 2011, Raquez et al., 2012, Frone et al., 2012). One of the most active areas in the research for new and developed materials for food packaging is the development of formulations with antimicrobial ability, where more than one substances with biocidal properties are included in a sachet, coated, adsorbed onto the materials surface or directly incorporated to the polymer during processing. Since microbial contamination is primarily a surface phenomenon, the incorporation of biocides to a film has many advantages due to their high exposure areas (Martínez-Abad et al., 2012, Fernandez et al., 2010). Various antimicrobials have been incorporated to polymer matrices for food packaging applications, such as organic acids (Weng and Chen, 1997), enzymes (Padgett et al., 1998), bacteriocins (Scannell et al., 2000), fungicides or other preservatives (Coma, 2008, Quintavalla and Vicini, 2002). But in the last years, antimicrobial silver has emerged as a new cost-effective additive to prevent microbial proliferation on food contact surfaces. Although much of the research on silver compounds is still focused on medical applications (Hetrick and Schoenfisch, 2006), silver is currently incorporated to a wide variety of materials used in daily life, ranging from textile clothing (Jeong et al., 2005), coatings in washing machines, refrigerators, furniture handles (Kampmann et al., 2008), to products where silver can be absorbed or ingested like in water treatment units and food-contact materials (Bouwmeester et al., 2009). The Food and Drug Administration / Centre for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (FDA / CFSAN-USA) accepted the use of silver nitrate as a food additive in bottled waters and silver zeolites for use in all types of food-contact polymers (FDA, 2007), while in the European Regulation silver is accepted under 94 / 36 / EC Directive as a colouring agent (E-174) with no restrictions. Additionally, silver zeolites have been approved in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2005) provisional list of substances for food-contact materials with a general restriction ⩽0.05 mg per kg food (Llorens et al., 2012). Besides the regulations, silver is the most widely used antimicrobial polymer additive in food applications (Martínez-Abad et al., 2012). However, the very low migration rates of silver ions from polymer matrices imply the need of silver filler contents of 2-5 wt% to be effective in food protection. These high silver contents could limit its application in antimicrobial packaging. Therefore a compromise between silver migration and antimicrobial activity needs to be critically analyzed to validate novel materials in food packaging applications. For the correct development and final application of silver as an effective additive in food packaging materials, it is critical to elucidate the threshold of its biocidal action and to optimize the silver contents to avoid the use of high amounts of this expendive additive. The aim of this research was the production and characterization of PLA-based high performance nano-biocomposites for active food packaging applications with cellulose nanocrystals and silver nanoparticles to enhance the polymer properties. Pristine (CNC) and surfactant modified cellulose nanocrystals (s-CNC) as well as silver (Ag) nanoparticles were used and ternary systems were prepared by solvent casting processing. The effect of cellulose crystal nano-dimensions, cellulose modifications and the combination of cellulose nanostructures with silver nanoparticles was evaluated in term of microstructure, crystallinity, barrier and migration properties.

The freeze-drying step is critical for the production of nano-biocomposites with uniform cellulose nanocrystal dispersions since the CNC tend to agglomerate into flakes during freeze-drying. The use of a surfactant is necessary, since it should be able to hinder hydrogen bonding between the cellulose nanocrystals during the freeze drying and further to aid the distribution of cellulose in an organic solvent such as chloroform (Fortunati et al., 2012a, Fortunati et al., 2012c).

TEM analysis of PLA / 1s-CNC / 1Ag and PLA / 5s-CNC / 1Ag ternary films reinforced with modified cellulose nanocrystals showed the good dispersion of s-CNC in the nanoscale (Fig. 2a and b), since well-defined single crystals were detected in the cross-section of both nano-biocomposites confirming some previous results (Fortunati et al., 2012a, Fortunati et al., 2012c). In a previous paper (Fortunati et al., 2012a), the different morphology induced by the unmodified CNC or surfactant modified s-CNC presence was deeply investigated underlining the positive effect of surfactant able to cover the crystals allowing a better dispersion in the matrix. However, in these TEM images it was difficult to identify single crystals because of the low contrast between PLA and cellulose structures, as previous reported (Fortunati et al., 2012b) and this effect was enhanced with the presence of silver nanoparticles having a completely different contrast with the polymer and cellulose structures. TEM images of these ternary systems also showed the silver nanoparticle distribution, highlighting the presence of isolated particles. But higher magnification micrographs showed the existence of some metal agglomerates formed during the evaporation process (Fig. 2c and d). However, in general terms, TEM analysis of ternary systems showed the high homogeneity of the dispersed Ag nanoparticles in the polymer surface. This result is important since it is demonstrated the availabity of a large accessible area for Ag chemical and physical interactions able to control the antibacterial activity. The structures of pure PLA and PLA ternary nano-biocomposites were characterized by Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) in order to study the effect of the nanocrystal type, content and combination with silver nanoparticles on the crystallinity of the PLA matrix. Fig. 3 shows WAXS curves for PLA and nano-biocomposites. PLA WAXS pattern only showed a wide diffraction band at 2θ = 16.5 °, giving a clear proof of this PLA amorphous nature. PLA ternary systems with 1 wt% of CNC or s-CNC and PLA with 5 wt% of CNC showed two main peaks at 2θ = 16.5 ° and 22.4 °, being indicative of the PLA and cellulose crystallinities, respectively (Fortunati et al., 2012a). However, when the nanocrystal content was 5 wt% , a steady increase in the intensity of the peaks at 2θ = 22.5 ° was observed in both, CNC and s-CNC systems, suggesting again an increase in the overall crystallinity of the nano-biocomposites. A different behaviour was detected in the case of PLA / 5s-CNC / 1Ag ternary system. A clear and intense peak at 2θ = 16.5 ° and the appearance of the peak at 2θ = 19 ° were indicative of the increased ability to crystallize of the modified-nanocrystal based systems as it was previously reported by other authors (Hossain et al., 2012). Moreover, for all the studied nano-biocomposites, in addition to the broad diffraction peak assigned to PLA cellulose crystallinities, four diffraction peaks at 2θ = 38.3 °, 44.2 °, 65.0 ° and 77.3 ° were observed. These small but significant peaks are attributed to Ag crystals since they correspond to the diffraction planes of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) of metal silver, respectively (Jeon et al., 2003). This implies that Ag nanoparticles are well embedded in the PLA based nano-biocomposites confirming the homogeneity in the nano-biocomposites microstructure already observed by TEM tests. "

Permeability results for PLA / 1Ag system are also reported for comparison. Nano-biocomposites showed reductions in OTR values with respect to the PLA film around 22% in the case of binary systems with 1 wt% of silver nanoparticles. Larger reductions in OTR were detected in the case of ternary systems. PLA / 1CNC / 1Ag showed a reduction of ca. 46% a similar reduction was observed in PLA / 5CNC / 1Ag. Even higher decreases in OTR were detected for the s-CNC based systems, underlining the positive effect of the cellulose modification in the barrier properties of ternary PLA systems as previously reported for binary nano-biocomposites reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals (Fortunati et al., 2012a). Moreover, a positive influence on barrier to oxygen of the s-CNC content was revealed since the nano-biocomposites with 5 wt% of modified cellulose also showed the best oxygen barrier properties (reduction of ca. 60% ) confirming also the increased ability to crystallize demonstrated by this system in WAXS analysis and resulting in sinergies between both effects, i.e. the presence of a larger amount of s-CNC and higher crystallinty of the composite. It is well known, in fact, that the transport properties of gases through polymer films are influenced by different factors such as the tortuousity of their path through the polymer structure, the degree of exfoliation or dispersion, the filler content, type, aspect ratio and orientation, the filler-induced crystallinity, the polymer chain inmobilization and the filler-induced solvent retention and porosity (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2008). In a previous work we observed a reduction in oxygen permeability of ca. 48% by reinforcing a PLA matrix with 5 wt% of s-CNC (Fortunati et al., 2012a). In this case we obtained a reduction of 54% in PLA / 1s-CNC / 1Ag using only 1 wt% of s-CNC and combining them with silver nanoparticles, reaching 60% of reduction in the PLA / 5s-CNC / 1Ag nano-biocomposite. The s-CNC and Ag nanoparticles combination produced an efficient barrier effect due to the good dispersion of the fillers showed in TEM analysis and the higher levels of crystallinity demonstrated by WAXS analysis. Since one of the main functions of films for food packaging is to decrease the moisture transfer between the food and the surrounding atmosphere, water vapour permeability is a significant physical parameter. High water vapour permeability of films considerably restricts their use as potential materials for food packaging (Morillon et al., 2000, Napierala and Nowotarska, 2006). The calculated coefficients for water vapour permeability in the studied formulations are reported in Table 2. WVP for PLA / 1Ag was very similar to the value obtained for neat PLA, underlining the low effect of silver nanoparticles in this parameter (Nassar and Youssef, 2012). In this case a similar trend to the OTR investigations was revealed for the ternary systems. Reductions in water permeability of ca. 46% were obtained for the PLA / 1CNC / 1Ag and PLA / 5CNC / 1Ag. Higher reductions in water permeability values (59% ), were detected for the systems loaded with modified s-CNC (PLA / 1s-CNC / 1Ag and PLA / 5s-CNC / 1Ag), highlighting, also in this case, the positive effect of cellulose modification on the WVP barrier properties.

368,Combined effects of cellulose nanocrystals and silver nanoparticles on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'PLA nano-biocomposite migration']"," Migration is the quantity of material, mainly additives, which can be transferred to foodstuff when they are in contact. Recent time migration has been considered a negative issue since substances are likely to constitute a danger to human health and / or alter the composition of foodstuff in an unacceptable manner. However, a new trend to active packaging is based on the migration as a positive issue in condition of the beneficial effect of some material additives (mainly antioxidants and / or antimicrobials) in foodstuff (Fortunati et al., 2012a, Schmidt et al., 2011). In this part of the study, overall and specific migration in PLA-based nano-biocomposites was evaluated. Results of overall migration for the samples in both food simulants (i.e. isooctane and ethanol 10% v / v) are shown in Fig. 4. Statistically significant differences (p ⩽ 0.05) were observed in the results obtained for ternary systems (confirming previous results about the binary formulations) and higher overall migration results were found in these samples compared to pristine PLA in both simulants studied. However, it should be noted that none of the samples exceeded the overall migration limit, since values were well below 60 mg kg^-1 of simulant. In the case of materials intended for active packaging, the study of the specific migration of selected additives is a critical issue. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated the use of several silver-based substances intended to come into contact with foods and defined a general specific migration limit of 0.05 mg of silver per kg of food (EFSA, 2005). Table 3 shows the results of the specific migration of nanosilver in both food simulants in contact conditions indicated in the current legislation. No significant differences were observed between sample PLA / 1Ag and the samples with cellulose added when the test was performed in isooctane, only PLA / 5s-CNC / 1Ag presented a higher release of Ag^+ to the isooctane. On the other hand, studies in ethanol 10% showed that the migration of Ag^+ from PLA / 1s-CNC / 1Ag and PLA / 5s-CNC / 1Ag ternary samples was significantly higher if compared with PLA / 1Ag and with unmodified cellulose based nano-biocomposites. The amount of silver transferred to isooctane from different formulations was well below the specific migration limit indicated by the EFSA, even the migration value in sample PLA / 1CNC / 1Ag and PLA / 1Ag in isooctane are below LOQ; while after 10 days of incubation the release of Ag to ethanol 10% (v / v) in nano-biocomposites with modified cellulose (s-CNC) exceeded the permitted limits. These results suggest that the plasticization of the PLA matrix in the ethanolic simulant improved the migration of Ag. Similar results were previously reported (Martínez-Abad et al., 2012) concerning the release of silver ions from EVOH to foodstuff. These authors proposed that the mechanism of release of silver was initiated by the sorption of the food moisture into the polymer surface. Furthermore, the plasticization caused by this increase in moisture in the bulk would result in an increase in diffusion of silver ions and consequently in the migration of this ion to foodstuff. This mechanism would depend on the food humidity and a faster release of the active components at high food humidities would be expectable. A similar behaviour would be expectable in these nano-biocomposites where the addition of surfactant to modify CNC would result in a partial plasticizer effect to increase the migration rate of ions to the aqueous simulants. Previous mechanical characterization of PLA based bio-nanocomposites loaded with cellulose nanostructures and silver nanoparticles proved an higher plastic response, with higher elongation at break values, for surfactant modified s-CNC based systems (PLA / 5s-CNC / 1Ag film had 60% of elongation at break) respect to the CNC based ternary film (PLA / 5CNC / 1Ag had 27% of elongation at break) due to the plasticizer effect produced by the surfactant presence (Fortunati et al., 2012b). In addition, the increase in polarity of the simulants enhanced the release rate of silver from the PLA nano-biocomposites as it was described elsewhere (Fortunati et al., 2012a, Bor et al., 2012). Since the specific migration of additives from polymer matrices is a critical issue in food packaging, a kinetic study of the Ag^+ release to food simulants from these nano-biocomposites was carried out. It is known that these processes are governed by diffusion and the migration models based on Fick’s second law (Eq. (3)) have been extensively used for the assessment of additives and contaminants migration from food packaging films (Chung et al., 2002, Fernandez et al., 2010). Fick law is often used to provide estimations of the diffusion coefficients based on experimental data. It was observed that diffusion coefficients for ternary composites with 1 or 5 wt% of s-CNC with values of D of (1.70±0.15) × 10^-16(cm^2 / s) and (7.40±0.05) × 10^-17(cm^2 / s), respectively. These were higher than those with the same amounts of unmodified CNC where D values of (5.03±0.05) × 10^-19 cm^2 / s and (1.50±0.03) × 10^-19 cm^2 / s, respectively were obtained; while the lowest values were detected in the case of the binary PLA / 1Ag composite (4.52±0.11) × 10^-20 (cm^2 / s). In summary, samples with modified cellulose nanocrystals showed migration levels higher than those allowed by EFSA, while values for PLA nano-biocomposites reinforced with unmodified CNC were below that limit. This behaviour was expected since it was already reported that the incorporation of cellulose nanocrystals to PLA matrices accelerated the hydrolytic degradation rate and therefore the additives migration (Xiang et al., 2012). In addition, it seemed that the diffusion of Ag^+ through the polymer filled with the modified s-CNC was faster than in samples with unmodified cellulose. This behaviour could be due to the higher affinity of the modified nanofiller to the polymer resulting in a composite structure where Ag^+ ions would have higher mobility and consequently their release would be easier. Fig. 5 shows the migration release of silver ions at different contact times for all the studied nano-biocomposites at 40 °C. Low migration of Ag^+ was observed for samples loaded with unmodified CNC and for the binary PLA / 1Ag composite, while higher migration of Ag^+ during the three first days of incubation was detected for the s-CNC nano-biocomposites. Significant differences (p ⩽ 0.05) were observed every analyzed day for samples with modified cellulose when data were compared with PLA / 1Ag. Moreover, PLA / 1s-CNC / 1Ag showed lower migration in comparison with PLA / 5s-CNC / 1Ag highlighting the effect of the cellulose modification and especially the cellulose nanocrystals content on the migration process. Xiang et al., 2012, also found that a higher content of cellulose nanocrystals produces a faster release of the additives from a PLA matrix, due to the morphology changes induced by the higher cellulose content. Furthermore nano-biocomposites processing had a striking effect on the silver releasing capability, as previously reported (Fernandez et al., 2010). These authors reported that solvent casting process is able to induce an easier additive migration from polymer matrices. They described that higher migration of silver zeolites was detected in samples produced by solvent casting than migration for the same formulations processed by melt blending. Similar results were previously described (Busolo et al., 2010): the maximum levels of Ag detected for solvent-casted biocomposite films could be 10-fold higher than the EFSA limit after 1 day of exposure and >100-fold higher in an accelerated regime. These authors also indicated that if these materials would be applied as solvent coating lower quantities of nanofiller are recommended and that it must be evaluated for each application. However, it is well known that due to chelating agents that could be present in food, higher concentrations of silver ions (over 5 mg of Ag kg^-1) would be necessary to achieve significant antimicrobial effects (Fernandez et al., 2009). These high concentrations could be unacceptable at the view of the current legislation that regulates the presence of silver in food. However, some studies showed that either inside the polymer or in aqueous solutions, the amount of silver necessary to affect the bacterial growth is in the range of 0.001-0.01 mg Ag kg^-1 (Martínez-Abad et al., 2012). Therefore, lower amounts of silver could be incorporated in the polymer matrix in order to satisfy the legislation requirements. Fig. 5 also shows that the amount of Ag^+ in the ethanol 10% v / v decreased with the incubation time. This unusual behaviour could be attributed to the gradual hydrolysis of the PLA in the food simulants that could “mask” the released Ag^+. As it was previously reported, PLA is gradually hydrolyzed in polar solvents, as it was reported elsewhere that polyester are weak to ethanol (Mutsuga et al., 2008, Fortunati et al., 2012a), therefore after 20 days in ethanol 10% at 40 °C it is expected that PLA could be hydrolyzed and therefore the determination of Ag^+ would be more difficult.

TEM analysis of binary systems showed the good dispersion of CNC and s-CNC in the nano-biocomposites, while ternary systems highlighted the presence of isolated silver nanoparticles but, at higher magnification, the existence of some metal agglomerates formed during the solvent evaporation process. The addition of 5 wt% of CNC and s-CNC increased the overall crystallinity of nano-biocomposites. However, new peaks were observed in the WAXS spectra of those samples with modified cellulose, suggesting an increase in the crystallinity of the nano-biocomposites. Ag nanoparticles were well embedded in the PLA based nano-biocomposites since the corresponding diffraction peaks of the metal silver were observed. The s-CNC and Ag nanoparticles combination produced an efficient barrier effect due to the well dispersion of the fillers. No samples exceeded the overall migration limit and it was observed that silver was easily released from these nano-biocomposites. Further studies using lower initial amounts of Ag will be carried out to ascertain compliancy with specific migration restrictions currently referenced by the EFSA. Therefore, the final conclusion of this work would be that the proposed nano-biocomposite based on PLA matrix, cellulose nanoreinforcements and Ag as active additive would be an adequate alternative to current film formulations for food companies.

However, the resulting extensive use of plastic packaging films raises serious environmental concerns. Replacing conventional plastic films with novel biobased and biodegradable under composting conditions materials such as films made of poly-lactic acid (PLA), offers new sustainable solutions to the problem. In the present work, the gas transport properties of three layer PLA films have been studied in relation to their potential as EMA packaging materials for fresh produce. A simple one-dimensional model simulating the combined gas diffusion through micro-perforations and the permeable membrane was developed as a designing tool for PLA based EMA packaging systems. By using this model, innovative biodegradable bio-based EMAP systems were designed specifically for selected fruits and vegetables using laser microperforated, water vapour (WV) permeable PLA films. It was shown that the relatively high water vapour permeability of PLA films compared to conventional OPP films allows the development of an optimised biodegradable bio-based EMA packaging for the specific applications.

382,Design of biodegradable bio-based equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) for fresh fruits and vegetables by using micro-perforated poly-lactic acid (PLA) films.xml,['Introduction']," Fruits and vegetables are two of the main agricultural product categories in Europe. Packaging is particularly important for exported fruits as it allows preserving their quality and health safety and facilitates labelling of the produce. Recently, advanced techniques such as equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) for dynamically modifying the in-package atmosphere are used for extending the shelf life of high value fresh produce (Sandhya, 2010). Successful applications of EMAP include a wide variety of produce, such as broccoli florets, cauliflower florets, carrots, baby carrots, peeled garlic (Lee et al., 1996). However, most of the published studies for recommended CO2 and O2 concentrations generally represent the conditions in the temperatures range of 0-5 °C that maximize the storage life of each commodity (Fernández-Trujilio et al., 1988, Malakou and Nanos, 2005, Irtwange, 2006). As the temperature increases O2 requirements from tissues increase too, while tolerance to CO2 decreases (Kader, 1997). The main disadvantage of EMAP, like any other conventional food packaging, is the extensive use of plastic films resulting into huge quantities of domestic plastic wastes. Global plastic film and sheets market is expected to reach 70.9 million tons by 2018 (Markets and Markets, 2014). A large percentage of this quantity is used for food packaging. Although recycling of these materials increased during the last decade, only a small part of the generated amount of plastic waste is finally recycled (Themelis et al., 2011). Therefore replacing non-degradable conventional plastics based on fossil oil with sustainable bio-based biodegradable materials is of great environmental importance. Various bio-based plastics have been studied already as possible alternatives to conventional packaging materials (Siracusa, 2008). Such a promising biodegradable plastic material is poly-lactic acid (PLA). PLA was introduced as a packaging material and started being produced at a commercial level about ten years ago. It has attracted attention mostly because of its sustainable nature: it is synthesized from processed corn or other naturally produced carbohydrates, thus it is a bio-based material, and it biodegrades after use under industrial composting conditions (Auras et al., 2004). PLA can be used for the development of transparent thin films suitable for food packaging (Auras et al., 2004). PLA’s certified compostability and compliance with the food contact safety regulations (Auras et al., 2004) makes it attractive as packaging material, since it meets the compostability requirements of EN13432 for packaging (EN 13.432, 2005), thus alleviating the plastic wastes problem. PLA exhibits high water vapour (WV) permeability compared to conventional plastic packaging films, while its permeability to CO2 and O2 is comparable. The performance of an EMA packaging greatly depends on its optimised design which has to be tailored to the needs of the specific packaged produce. Gases are exchanged between the package and the environment by a restricted diffusion process resulting into an EMA in the package. In a typical EMAP the synthesis of the in-package atmosphere is controlled by selecting the gas transport properties of the packaging film. The equilibrium (steady state) modified atmosphere (EMA) is obtained when the exchange rate of gases through the covering film is in equilibrium with the production or consumption of gases at the respiring and transpiring produce. Therefore, the gas transport properties of the packaging system have to be designed to meet the specific requirements of the packaged produce. A technique for adjusting the gas transport properties of a packaging film is perforation. Both macro-perforation by mechanical means (Van der Steen et al., 2002) and laser made micro-perforation (Ozdemir et al., 2005) are used for this purpose. In the case of a perforated film, the diffusion is not spatially uniform and the combined transmission effect of both perforations and film has to be investigated. The size and the number of perforations have to be estimated to meet the specific needs of the packaged fruits or vegetables for a given packaging configuration. For this reason, the development of a model predicting the gas transfer through a perforated film is a necessary tool for designing the perforation pattern. Such a model has to take into account the combined gas transport through both the packaging film and the perforations (Paul and Clarke, 2002, Rennie and Tavoularis, 2009, Briassoulis et al., 2013). Several attempts have been made to model gas transfer through a perforated permeable film for optimizing EMAP (Paul and Clark, 2002; Rennie and Tavoularis, 2009). These models focus on the gas diffusion through a perforation (Chung et al., 2003), while the film itself is considered impermeable (barrier film) (Chung et al., 2003, Gonzalez et al., 2008). Such modelling approaches are based on Fick’s law of diffusion (Chung et al., 2003) or Stefan-Maxwell law (Rennie and Tavoularis, 2009). The simplest model assumes Fick’s diffusion in a cylindrical pore filled with stagnant air simulating the perforation. However, an end correction term for the diffusive path length must be introduced to compensate for end effects at the mouths of the hole (Chung et al., 2003). Certain models also take into account convection mass transfer in the headspace between the produce and the packaging film due to temperature differences (Rennie and Tavoularis, 2009). However, this effect has a limited importance. Relevant to the present work are studies concerning the use of films made of other biodegradable materials for food packaging (Avella et al., 2005, Siracusa et al., 2008). Most of these bio-based films are rather permeable in water vapour. The gas transport properties of these films are particularly interesting for further optimizing EMAP systems. The present work focuses on the use of micro-perforated PLA films for designing optimized equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) for fresh fruits and vegetables. Recent studies indicate that PLA is a versatile packaging material, which may contribute to a longer shelf-life of the packaged produce (Almenar et al., 2008, Briassoulis et al., 2013). The main objective of the present work was the development of a one-dimensional steady state analytical model of the in-package atmosphere assuming that WV transport process through the permeable packaging film obeys Fick’s law. Using this analytical model, packaging bags made of PLA have been optimally designed and developed for two selected horticultural produce: cherry tomatoes and peach, as typical high value vegetables and fruits respectively. These optimized packaging systems were tested through full-scale experiments to confirm the validity of the design methodology. "

The gas barrier property of a material is expressed by its gas mass permeability P (kg m m^-2 s^-1 Pa^-1). This is defined as the gas mass (kg) which, under steady conditions, crosses unit area (m^2) and unit thickness (m) of the specimen, in unit time (s) under unit pressure difference (Pa) and at constant temperature. In particular, the permeability of a plate or membrane is expressed by the one-dimensional Fick’s law of diffusion as:(1)F=-PAdpdxwhere F (kg s^-1) is the mass flow rate of the gas, dp / dxis the gradient of the gas pressure across the specimen (Pa m^-1) and A (m^2) is the area of the membrane. If a gas mixture is considered, gas pressure, p (Pa) refers to the partial pressure of a gas in the mixture, thus it is a measure of the molar fraction, c, of the gas in the mixture. In the case of a gas mixture, the partial pressure gradient can also be expressed as the molar fraction gradient of the gas, dc / dx(m^-1). Then the mass permeability is expressed in (kg m m^-2 s^-1) and the volume permeability in m^2 s^-1. When a thin film is considered, its gas transfer characteristics are described by the permeance, PR. In the Standard ASTM-E96 / E96-05 (ASTM, 2005) water vapour permeance PR (kg m^-2 s^-1) is defined by the equation:(2)PR=FAΔc=PLwhere L (m) is the thickness of the thin film. An additional, practically used measure of the barrier property of a film is its gas transmission rate, TR. In the Standard ASTM-E96 / E96-05 the transmission rate TR (kg m^-2 s^-1) of a gas through a film of thickness L (m), that crosses unit area (m^2) of the specimen, in unit time (s) for a specific molar fraction difference Δc, is then defined as:(3)TR=FA=PR×Δc "
384,Design of biodegradable bio-based equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) for fresh fruits and vegetables by using micro-perforated poly-lactic acid (PLA) films.xml,"['Materials and methods', 'The modified Fick’s law for gas diffusion through a hole']"," The diffusion coefficient D (m^2 s^-1) of a gas in a gas mixture, such as air, is defined as the diffusion volume flow rate FD (m^3 s^-1) divided by the molar fraction gradient of the gas, dcdx, per unit area. The gas diffusion through a single perforation (e.g., an impermeable film with one hole) may be modelled as diffusion through a tube of finite length. Diffusion at the mouth of a tube differs from the diffusion at its interior due to end effects. If the aspect ratio (thickness / diameter) of the tube (hole) is high then the diffusion through this hole is described well by Fick’s law. On the other hand, low aspect ratios mean that end effects are important. An empirical modification of Fick’s law (Eq. (4)) incorporating end effects makes this equation appropriate for describing diffusion through perforations (Chung et al., 2003):(4)FD=DAΔcL+kd In this case the gas volume flow rate FD (m^3 s^-1) is the diffusion flow rate through a hole, D (m^2 s^-1) is the diffusion coefficient of the considered gas in air, L (m) is the thickness of the film, Δc is the molar fraction difference of the gas across the hole, A (m^2) is the area of the perforation, d (m) is the perforation diameter and k is a phenomenological factor describing the end effects of the perforation (Chung et al., 2003). Typical k factor (Eq. (4)) values, representative of the end effects of the perforation are provided in the literature. They range between 0.4 and 1.0 (Gonzalez et al., 2008). For the extreme value of k = 0 this empirical law corresponds to Fick’s law. "

For this reason, the transport properties of PLA films with respect to these gases have been investigated. In the experimental investigation three-layer PLA films of 30 μm thickness produced by Taghleef Industries (NATIVIA) were used. In these films, the core PLA is coated on both sides by a thin layer of sealable PLA. The WVTR was gravimetrically measured using the water method described in the ASTM-E96 / E96-05 Standard (ASTM, 2005). Specially designed dishes of 80 mm diameter able to tightly hold a sample film at their open top, were developed. In each test dish, 20 ml of distilled water were added leaving a distance of approximately 8 mm between the water surface and the film. The dishes were placed in a controlled environment room with temperature 23±0.5 °C and RH equal to 50±5% and their weight was measured once per day by a balance (model OHAUS Ts4kd) with accuracy of 0.01 g. The decrease of the weight of each dish was found linear with time, and the regression slope was used for estimating the WV mass flow rate F (kg s^-1) through the film. The WVTR (kg m^-2 s^-1) was calculated from Eq. (3). A flask of volume equal to 2 L was sealed by the studied PLA film. An amount of CO2 was blown in the flask resulting to an initial CO2 molar fraction with respect to air in the flask equal to co. The molar fraction, c(t), of the CO2 was measured using an IR CO2 sensor (QUBIT S147, QUBIT Systems Inc.) as a function of time. Due to the transmission of CO2 through the PLA film, its molar fraction decreased exponentially with time. Then the CO2 permeability P (kg m m^-2 s^-1) was calculated from Eq. (5):(5)c(t)=coe-PAρVLtwhere: A (m^2) is the surface of the film, V (m^3) is the volume of the flask, ρ (kg m^-3) is the density of CO2, and L (m) is the thickness of the film. Oxygen permeability was measured by a similar method. An amount of nitrogen was blown into a flask to reduce the molar fraction of oxygen with respect to air. The volume of the flask was equal to 2 L. Then the oxygen molar fraction was measured using a paramagnetic O2 sensor (QUBIT S147, QUBIT Systems Inc.). The oxygen permeability, P (kg m m^-2 s^-1), was calculated from Eq. (6):(6)c(t)=catm-coe-PAρVLtwhere: ρ (kg m^-3) is the density of O2, co is the initial molar fraction of O2 in the flask, catm (% ) is the oxygen atmospheric molar fraction, and catm-co (% ) is the oxygen molar fraction in the flask at time 0. Both measurements of CO2 and O2 permeability were performed in a controlled chamber environment where the temperature was 23±0.5 °C and the RH was 50±5% . "

(4) was experimentally determined for the specific material studied in this work. Since the factor k is independent of the gas properties, its value can be estimated by studying the diffusion of any typical gas through a perforation in a barrier film. In the present work, water vapour was used as the tracer gas for validating Eq. (4). The WVTR of holes with diameter in the range between 0.1-6 mm perforated in a typical 30 μm thick PLA film (Taghleef Industries—NATIVIA) was measured. The gas transport through a film with multiple perforations was also studied. Water vapour was used as the tracer gas. The WVTR was measured by using the Standard testing method ASTM-E96 / E96-05. In this case an OPP film was used instead of PLA for covering the test dishes in order to investigate the gas transport through multiple perforations in an impermeable film. The analysed cases had 1, 2, 3 and 4 perforations of equal diameter of 100 μm. The holes were perforated along a line at 1 cm distance from each other. "

A rigid dish simulating the equipment used in the ASTM-E96 / E96-05 Standard was numerically modelled. The dish had 40 mm radius and 8 mm height, and it was covered at the top by an impermeable membrane perforated at its centre. The elements along the circumference of the perforation had edges of a minimum length equal to 0.2 mm (Fig. 1). As the grid expanded to the membrane surface away from the perforation the elements became larger (maximum edge length 2 mm). In this way the accuracy of the solution is higher close to the perforation where the gas exchange occurs. The entire test dish model was discretized using 220.000 elements and 41.000 nodes. The model was also discretized through finer grids but the results showed no sensitivity. All surfaces of the test dish model were considered impermeable to gas exchange except for the bottom surface and the perforation at the upper surface of the model. The diffusion coefficient, D, of the WV in air was set equal to 2.5 × 10^-5 m^2 s^-1 as given in literature (Massman, 1998). The lower surface was modelled as an inlet (simulating the water surface) with constant RH value of 100% while the perforation was treated as an opening (exchanging WV with the environment). The pressure of the external environment of the dish (and the hole) was set equal to zero (WV expands to a significantly larger area) and the RH was assumed to be equal to 50% (ambient conditions). Convergence was reached when the WV mass fraction residual was smaller than 10^-7. The WVTR as a function of the perforation diameter was analysed by numerical simulations. Gases were transported through a single perforation located at the centre of an impermeable membrane covering the top of a test dish model (Fig. 1). The simulation was performed for different perforation diameters and the diffusion gas volume flow rate through the single hole was measured. The smaller perforation diameter in the numerical model was set equal to 2.5 mm. Other perforations tested had size equal to 2, 4, 6, 8 and 20 times the initial diameter. A similar test dish with impermeable surfaces, of the dimensions shown in Fig. 1 was simulated numerically to investigate the effect of multiple perforations. The grid of the numerical model consisted of tetrahedral elements with similar dimensions to the previous test. Elements and corresponding nodes were slightly increased around each additional perforation to improve mesh quality. Boundary conditions were the same as in the numerical simulation of a film with a single perforation. Convergence was set again to 10^-7 of the WV mass fraction residual. All perforations had the same diameter, equal to 5 mm and the film thickness was 1 mm. Four perforations were positioned at the vertices of a square of a 5 cm edge. Simulations were performed when 1, 2, 3 and 4 perforations were open. "

Additionally, 200 tomatoes divided into 10 unwrapped trays (20 fruits per tray) served as control. Since pathogens growth affects fruit respiration and ethylene production rates, in-package gas composition was monitored in bags containing tomatoes treated with a fungicide. For this purpose, the fruits of five bags per packaging configuration (PLA, OPP) were dipped before packaging for 60 s in a fungicidal solution at 20 °C containing 600 mg / L fludioxonil (Scholar, Syngenta Crop Protection, Milan, Italy). In all cases, tomatoes were laid directly into the bags without any tray (Fig. 2a).

Actually, the corresponding transmission rate (TR) decreases as the hole diameter increases due to end effects. The WVTR through a single perforation, measured with the experimental set-up of Section 2.4, with the hole diameter in the range between 0.1 and 6 mm perforated in a typical 30 μm thick PLA film, is shown in Fig. 3. Using the following Eq. (7), which is derived from Eq. (4), k was estimated equal to 0.43 by a linear interpolation of the experimental data of Fig. 3.(7)DAΔcFD-L=kdThe numerically determined value of k was found equal to 0.30, which is smaller than the experimentally measured value, 0.43 (Fig. 3). The experimental result agrees better with previous experimental research works (Gonzalez et al., 2008) that determined parameter k in the range between 0.4 and 1.0. The difference between the experimentally determined value of k and the one obtained by numerical simulations is a result of the geometric details of the perforation edge. Manually perforated or laser made perforations have rougher edges compared to an ideal numerically modelled hole. Therefore, the edge effects are weaker than reality in the case of the numerical simulation. "

The results are presented in terms of the overall TR through a perforated film normalized by the TR of a single perforation. Both experimental and numerical data show that the TR increases proportionally to the number of the perforations. The interaction between neighbouring perforations was also studied numerically (Fig. 4b). It was shown that the total transmission rate through a pair of perforations decreases with the distance between the two holes due to their interaction. However, this effect becomes negligible when the ratio L / d is smaller than 5, as it is shown in Fig. 4b. This result explains the small deviation of the numerical results from the exact linear relationship observed in Fig. 4a. The combined outcome of the gas transport experiments and analyses through a single and multiple perforations indicates that multiple perforations result into higher TR than a single hole of equal total open area. Moreover, the results presented in Fig. 4 show that there is a linear relationship between the TR of a perforated film and the number of the perforations provided that their distance is not smaller than 5 times their diameter. This fact simplifies the EMA package modelling and design. "

The basic assumptions of this model are the following:1.Gas transport through a perforated membrane takes place through both the film and the perforations.2.Gas transport through a non-perforated film is governed by Eq. (2). The WV and CO2 permeance PR (kg m^-2 s^-1) of a PLA film of 30 μm thickness is taken equal to 6.4 × 10^-5 kg m^-2 s^-1 and 2.0 × 10^-7 kg m^-2 s^-1 respectively based on the data presented in Table 2.3.Gas transport through a hole of the film (perforation) is governed by the modified Fick’s law (Eq. (4)), where k is taken equal to 0.5 as approximately measured (Fig. 3).4.Gas diffusion volume flow rate through multiple perforations is the superposition of flow rates of separate holes assuming that the distance between holes is at least larger than 5 times their diameter. Gas transport through a perforated membrane takes place through both the film and the perforations. Gas transport through a non-perforated film is governed by Eq. (2). The WV and CO2 permeance PR (kg m^-2 s^-1) of a PLA film of 30 μm thickness is taken equal to 6.4 × 10^-5 kg m^-2 s^-1 and 2.0 × 10^-7 kg m^-2 s^-1 respectively based on the data presented in Table 2. Gas transport through a hole of the film (perforation) is governed by the modified Fick’s law (Eq. (4)), where k is taken equal to 0.5 as approximately measured (Fig. 3). Gas diffusion volume flow rate through multiple perforations is the superposition of flow rates of separate holes assuming that the distance between holes is at least larger than 5 times their diameter. The design of the EMAP system has to take into account that two independent physiological processes of the fruits need to be regulated, namely the respiration and the transpiration. Transpiration is a more intense process producing 20 times larger volume of WV compared to the CO2 volume produced through respiration. Considering that diffusion coefficient, D, of WV in air is 25 × 10^-6 m^2 s^-1 compared to 14 × 10^-6 m^2 s^-1 of CO2 (Massman, 1998), the perforation pattern cannot be designed for regulating simultaneously both respiration and transpiration. Therefore, one of these two gases has to be exchanged through a selectively permeable covering material such as PLA film. The basic design concept is the following: If perforation is designed to regulate in-package CO2 molar fraction at the desired level, its effect on the in-package RH is negligible due to the much higher transpiration rate compared to respiration. However, PLA is a hydrophilic material with WV permeability much higher than its CO2 permeability. Therefore, when PLA film is used as a packaging material in EMAP systems, the perforation pattern can be designed for controlling only the CO2 molar fraction, while the area of the packaging film surface can be designed for controlling the in-package RH. In this way, the in-package atmosphere can be adjusted to the required composition with respect to all relevant gases that are important for a specific horticultural produce. Since the O2 permeability of PLA is similar to CO2, oxygen molar fraction can also be efficiently regulated through the perforation together with CO2 molar fraction. "

Optimal EMAP bags made of micro-perforated PLA film were designed for these two high value horticultural produce in order to validate the model. The design of the optimised EMAP systems was based on the respiration and transpiration flow rates and the targeted in-package RH and CO2 molar fraction which are presented in Table 1. "

Accordingly, a typical transpiration rate was considered approximately equal to 58 μg of WV kg^-1 s^-1 at the selected conditions. Similarly, respiration rate of cherry tomatoes was measured to be between 5.2 and 7.9 μg CO2 kg^-1 s^-1. Based on the targeted headspace values shown in Table 1, the surface of the packaging material and the number of perforations were determined to fit the targeted RH (80-90% ) and CO2 molar fraction (3-4% ) respectively. PLA films of 30 μm thickness were used with laser perforations of 200 μm diameter. The CO2 transmission rate of the micro-perforations of 200 μm diameter were calculated by using the modified Fick’s law (Eq. (4)). By applying this equation for such a hole on a film of 30 μm thickness, the CO2 transmission rate of a single hole was calculated equal to 0.94 mg / h if the targeted CO2 molar fraction is 4% . Therefore, 20-21 holes per kilogram of cherry tomatoes will generate a steady state EMAP with CO2 molar fraction equal to 4% . Hence, 5 holes of 200 μm are necessary for obtaining the optimal EMA for a package of 250 g cherry tomatoes in terms of CO2 and O2. A package of 250 g of cherry tomatoes at 20 °C and RH 85% which is within the targeted EMAP range approximately produces 14 μg s^-1 of WV due to transpiration (Table 1). The RH in the storage room was set equal to 65% . Two different values of the in-package RH were targeted, 80% (PLA80) and 90% (PLA90). These RH values at 20 °C correspond to molar fraction differences equal to 0.0036 and 0.0060 respectively, calculated from the psychrometric diagram. Using Eq. (3), the WVTR of a PLA film of 30 μm thickness was calculated from the permeance shown in Table 2, equal to 0.22 mg m^-2 s^-1 for the case (PLA80), and 0.35 mg m^-2 s^-1 for the case (PLA90). Assuming that in equilibrium the WV flow rate through the total area of the packaging film has to be equal to the transpiration rate of the total packaged produce, the area of the PLA film required for obtaining the necessary WV removal rate for a 250 g package of cherry tomatoes was calculated equal to 650 cm^2 and 400 cm^2, respectively for 80% (PLA80) and 90% (PLA90) in-package RH at 20 °C.

The respiration rate of peaches was measured to vary between 11.4 and 20.8 μg CO2 kg^-1 s^-1. For designing the perforation pattern, the respiration rate of peaches was selected equal to 18 μg CO2 kg^-1 s^-1. The transpiration rate was measured in the range of 35-46 μg of WV kg^-1 s^-1 in an environment of 20 °C temperature and RH = 85% (Table 1). The same PLA films of 30 μm thickness were used as the packaging material with laser perforations of diameter equal to 200 μm. A lower CO2 molar fraction compared to cherry tomatoes (Table 1), specifically 1-3% , was targeted for peaches. In the case of peaches 100 holes of 200 μm are required for obtaining the targeted value of 2% CO2 for a typical package of 700 g of peaches. The area of the packaging film had to be adjusted accordingly. The transpiration rate of peaches at 20 °C and RH in the range of 85-90% , which is the targeted EMAP value, was measured equal to 35-46 μg of WV kg^-1 s^-1 (Table 1). Assuming as a typical case a transpiration rate equal to 35 μg of WV kg^-1 s^-1, a typical package of 700 g of peaches produces 24 μg s^-1 WV at the targeted in-package RH equal to 85% . The RH in the storage room was set equal to 65% . The WVTR of the packaging film for this RH difference was calculated equal to 0.27 mg m^-2 s^-1 from the data of Table 2 using Eq. (3) with the help of the psychrometric diagram. Considering that in equilibrium the WV flow rate through the total area of the packaging film has to be equal to the transpiration rate of the total packaged produce, the area of the PLA film required for obtaining the necessary WV removal rate for a 700 g package of peaches was estimated equal to 900 cm^2.

The RH in the storage room was 65±4% , showing marked fluctuations. As a result, RH also fluctuated inside the packages, although at a lesser extent. The average package RH was 79.8±2% and 85±2% in the PLA80 and PLA90 bags, respectively, values which are very close to the expected ones, especially in PLA80. In contrast, in OPP bags RH was always higher than 90% , with peaks of 95-98% , despite the four 6-mm holes per bag, while the presence of condensation inside the packages was frequently detected. Weight losses of unwrapped fruit after the eleven days of storage were 7.7% (Fig. 5a), with an average weight loss per day of 6.9 g kg^-1. Fruit sealed in PLA80 and PLA90 bags at the end of storage lost 5.09% and 4.66% of their initial weight respectively, which is equivalent to 4.6 and 4.2 g kg^-1 per day. This measured transpiration rate is within the range of 35-70 μg kg^-1 s^-1 reported in Table 1. The weight loss in OPP bags were only 3.3% , equivalent to 3 g kg^-1 per day (Fig. 5a). The results presented in Fig. 5a also show that the standard deviation of weight losses is much smaller in both PLA and OPP packages compared to unwrapped fruits. This indicates that the PLA packaging generated a stable in-package atmosphere offering a predictable control. As shown in Fig. 5b, no rotten fruits were detected over the 11 days of storage when they were kept unpackaged. In contrast in packaged fruit decay developed from day 8 and further increased after 11 days of storage (Fig. 5b). Decay incidence was affected by the type of the package: for fruits sealed in PLA80 packages there was no decay after 8 days and only 4% of rotten fruit were detected after 11 days. Slightly higher levels of decay developed in PLA 90 packages, while considerably higher losses occurred in OPP packages. The stem end scar is generally the starting site of decay in cherry tomatoes (see Fig. 6), however if the scar is dry it is difficult for pathogens to start the infection. As a result, in unpackaged fruit no decay occurred over the storage time. In contrast, the higher humidity inside the packages enhanced pathogen growth, and the effect was more pronounced in OPP packages due to the higher humidity and the presence of condensation. The presence of condensed water prevented the drying process of the stem end scar, but also caused cracks of the peel starting from the end scar, thus increasing fruit susceptibility to decay. Therefore, the high in-package humidity in OPP packages which reduced weight loss also resulted into a higher susceptibility of the fruits to decay. On the other hand, the PLA packaging offered a better optimized, balanced EMA which combined a considerable reduction in weight loss with a slower decay due to pathogens. Thus, if in one hand high levels of humidity strongly suppress transpiration and weight loss, on the other hand may favour growth of spoilage microorganisms (Kader et al., 1989). As shown by Boylan-Pett (1986), the appearance of moulds, which were associated with high levels of in-package humidity, resulted in a shorter shelf-life of red-ripe tomatoes packaged in an EMAP of low density polyethylene (LDPE) designed for optimal levels of O2 and CO2 compared to tomatoes stored in a flow-throw system with the same gas molar fractions. The PLA bags offer an optimal packaging solution by reducing the decay incidences compared to the OPP bags while keeping weight loss limited. In fact, the appearance of fruit sealed in PLA bags did not show differences with respect to those sealed in OPP macro bags, despite the higher reduction in weight (the score was in all cases higher than 8); while a significant deterioration of the appearance (average score 6.2) was detected only in unwrapped fruits. After 4 days of storage in-package CO2 in the PLA bags was 3.5 kPa, but declined to 2.51 kPa after 11 days, while in-package O2 increased from 17.6% to 18.7% , with no significant difference between PLA80 and PLA90. In contrast, air composition in OPP bags, as expected, was slightly different than air and did not change over storage (CO2 ≈ 0.02 kPa; O2 ≈ 20.5 kPa). The initial CO2 (after 4 days of packaging) molar fraction measured in PLA bags compared well with the value, 4% , predicted by the analytical model. The reduction of CO2 with storage time in the case of PLA packaging is not a weakness of the model, but a consequence of the decline in respiratory activity during storage. In fact, respiration rate decreased from the initial value of 5.4 μg CO2 kg^-1 s^-1 to the final value of 2.6 μg CO2 kg^-1 s^-1. Cherry tomatoes are harvested when full ripe, after the climacteric phase, thus, unless fruit are subjected to physical stress (mechanical impacts, wounds, chilling temperatures) or invaded by pathogens, low rates of ethylene production can be expected. Accordingly, ethylene rates of unwrapped samples never exceeded 2.6 × 10^-4 μg kg^-1 s^-1, while in-package ethylene concentration in PLA bags ranged between 0.5 and 0.8 μL L^-1. The result is an environmental friendly packaging offering a longer shelf time with better quality and safer cherry tomatoes. "

In-package temperature was always between the variations range of the storage room. Average room RH was 64.7% , ranging between 60.47 and 67.66% . Average RH in PLA85 bags was 87% , a value in good agreement with the target RH of the designed PLA package, while in OPP macro-perforated (OPPmacro) bags average RH was 98% . In both types of packages RH showed slight changes over time, but in OPPmacro bags condensation was constantly present. Weight losses of unwrapped fruits after three days of storage were 3.4% and increased to values higher than 14% at the end of storage, with an average weight loss per day of 11 g kg^-1 (Fig. 7a). This high value of transpiration rate might be due to the large variability in daily weight loss shown by the individual fruits, which had a standard deviation of 1.7 g kg^-1. Packaging not only reduced weight loss, but also eliminated the variability of transpiration among fruits. In fact, fruits sealed into PLA film experienced only 1.04% weight loss after 3 days and was less than 4% after 9 days, which is equivalent to 3.46 g kg^-1 per day, while in OPPmacro bags the final weight loss were less than 1% . The high transpiration of unwrapped fruit significantly affected fruit appearance, which had an average score of 5.2 since day 6 of storage, but with a high percentage of fruit below the limit of marketability. In contrast the score of wrapped fruit was always higher than 8 and differences between PLA85 and OPPmacro were not significant. After 3 days of storage no rotten fruits were observed neither among unwrapped nor among packaged ones of both types of films. Six days later, decay developed in all packaging configurations with about 8, 12 and 18% of rotten fruits in unwrapped, PLA85 and OPPmacro treatments, respectively. After 9 days the percentage of rotten fruit did not change significantly in unwrapped and PLA85 bags, while increased to 57% in OPP bags (Fig. 7b). As observed in the case of cherry tomatoes, humidity levels lower than 90% is a good compromise to reduced transpiration rate, preserve overall appearance and delay pathogens growth. In contrast higher levels of humidity, associated with temperature fluctuations during storage may cause the formation of condensation inside the packages and lead to a rapid decay. The CO2 molar fraction in the PLA bags was between 2.0 and 3.0 kPa in good agreement with the targeted value as presented in Table 1 despite the high variability of respiration activity detected over storage among the ten unwrapped fruits. In-package average ethylene concentration in PLA bags was slightly below 2 μL C2H4 L^-1 during the first three days, then it increased progressively, with final values of about 6 μL C2H4 L^-1, showing that the fruit were in their ripening stage during storage, as confirmed by increasing rates measured in unwrapped fruit. In contrast, in OPPmacro bags both CO2 and O2 were slightly different than air, and ethylene ranged between 0.3 and 0.8 μL C2H4 L^-1. Despite the high level of ethylene present inside the PLA bags, the fruits did not show detectable differences in appearance and in their ripening stage with respect to those sealed in OPP films, denoting no evident effect of the high level of ethylene inside PLA bags, whose potential physiological impact on fruit tissue might be counteracted by the higher levels of CO2 in PLA85 bags (Burg, 2004).

410,Design of biodegradable bio-based equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) for fresh fruits and vegetables by using micro-perforated poly-lactic acid (PLA) films.xml,['Conclusions']," An analytical, user friendly, one-dimensional model was developed for designing a biodegradable bio-based EMAP system for selected fruits and vegetables using PLA films. The model was developed simulating the combined gas diffusion through micro-perforations and the permeable PLA membrane of the EMA packaging system. It was shown that the relatively high water vapour (WV) permeability of PLA films compared to conventional OPP films allows the development of an optimised biodegradable bio-based EMA packaging system for the specific applications. The parameters of this model were determined through a series of laboratory and numerical experiments. Two lab experiments were performed under real conditions for validating the model. Cherry tomatoes and peaches were used as typical representatives of vegetables and fruits for testing the newly designed EMA packaging systems. The model predictions compared well against the corresponding measurements confirming its validity. PLA was shown to be a versatile material which allows through a proper design, for a better control of the in-package atmosphere than conventional materials due to its higher permeability to water vapour combined with its barrier properties with respect to CO2 and O2. This PLA property in combination with the laser micro-perforation technology makes possible the development of optimal EMAP systems fitting the exact needs of specific high value horticultural products. In this way, their quality and safety is preserved for a longer shelf life period by using a bio-based and compostable material. "

Renewable resource based on biodegradable polymers like cellulose, has the potential to be used as an alternative to petroleum-based polymers. Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer in nature are obtained from various plants and living organisms (Nakagaito, Iwamoto, & Yano, 2005). Cellulose is light, environment friendly and biodegradable. It has low cost, specific strength and modulus. It is a polysaccharide consisting of liner chain of several hundred to over ten thousand β (1→4) linked d-glucose units, is an almost inexhaustible biopolymer with outstanding properties (Klemm et al., 2005, Nishiyama et al., 2002, Updegraff, 1969). For many years it has been an important raw material used in the form of intact wood for construction purpose, natural textile fibres and papers. Cellulose derivatives have been used as optical films, coating, controlled released systems, biodegradable plastics, biomedical materials and composites (Bledzki & Gassan, 1999). More recently, attention was devoted to nanocomposites based on cellulose (Fahmy et al., 2006, Fahmy, 2007a, Fahmy, 2007b, Fahmy and Mobarak, 2008a, Fahmy and Mobarak, 2009, Fahmy and Mobarak, 2011, Fahmy and Mobarak, 2013) and inorganic nano particle such as SiO2 (Pinto, Marques, Barros Timmons, Trindade, & Pascoal Neto, 2008), TiO2 (Marques, Trindade, & Pascoal Neto, 2006) and kaolin particle (Fahmy & Mobarak, 2008b). These materials normally show improved mechanical, optical and thermal properties due to the combination of inorganic and organic components in the final materials. Park, Liang, Mohanty, Mishra, and Drzal (2004) prepared the biodegradable cellulose acetate / organoclay nanocomposites and reported the improvement of mechanical properties due to good exfoliation and dispersion of clay in the cellulose acetate matrix. The cellulose-montmorillonite nanocomposites were prepared and the increase in thermo-oxidative stability as compared to the cellulose was reported (Cerruti et al., 2008). He, Chang, Peng, and Zhang (2012) prepared the cellulose / hydroxyaptite nanocomposites films and reported the improvement of thermal stability and mechanical strength. The cellulose / calcium carbonate nanocomposites having improved mechanical properties as compared to the virgin cellulose were synthesized and characterized (Vilela, Freire, Marques, Trindade, & Pascoal Neto, 2010). Pranger and Tannenbaum (2008) synthesized the biobased nanocomposites of furfuryl alcohol with cellulose whisker and montmorillonite clay and reported their high thermal resistance. Cellulose acetate / calcium carbonate hybrid nanocomposites were prepared and better thermal stability than pristine cellulose acetate was observed (John, Chen, & Kim, 2012). Seydibeyoglu and Oksman (2008) prepared the novel nanocomposites based on polyurethane and micro fibrillated cellulose by compression moulding and reported the improvement of mechanical and thermal properties of polyurethane due to the addition of nano cellulose. The use of nano fibres in composite materials has recently been reviewed (Azizi Samir, Alloin, & Dufresne, 2005). Boldizar, Klason, Kubat, Naslund, and Saha (1987) reported that cellulose nanocomposites based on poly (vinyl acetate) matrix showed significantly improved mechanical properties as compared to the base material. Bacterial cellulose-poly (vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites were prepared by in situ process and reduction in Young's modulus and increase in toughness was observed (Gea, Billotti, Reynolds, Soykeabkeaw, & Peijs, 2010). Among different nano fillers, silicon carbide is an important and non-oxide ceramic material having diversified industrial applications due to its exclusive properties such as, high melting point, oxidation resistance, high erosion resistance, high hardness, strength, chemical and thermal stability (Saravanan, Subramanian, Vishnu Kumar, & Tharanathan, 2006). Silicon carbide can occur in more than 250 crystalline forms called polytypes and has attracted much attention these days as it has a good match of chemical, mechanical and thermal properties (Guo et al., 2008). The effect of nanometre SiC filler on Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) was studied for improvement of tribological behaviours of PEEK composites (Wang, Xue, Liu, & Chen, 2000). There are a lot of works on cellulose based composites, but the work related to nano SiC reinforced cellulose nanobiocomposites is scanty in the literature. In the present study environmental friendly SiC reinforced nanobiocomposites were synthesized from biodegradable cellulose. The nanobiocomposites were characterized by XRD and TEM to verify the silicon carbide contents in the composites. Tensile, gas barrier and thermal property of the composites were measured. A significant improvement of thermal property with reduction in gas barrier property was noticed in order to enable the materials for packaging applications. "

Oxygen permeability was found to be reduced proportionately with increasing concentration of the nano SiC. With 10% SiC loading, the oxygen permeability of cellulose / SiC nanocomposite was reduced by three times as compared to virgin cellulose. The reduction in oxygen permeability is because of the fact that silicon carbide nanoparticles are present within the voids of cellulose creating the restrictive path for oxygen penetration. Further, it was observed that oxygen flow rate through all the nanobiocomposites was less as compared to the virgin cellulose at a constant pressure of 2 psi. The flow rate was decreased with increase in percentage of SiC loading.

436,Edible oxygen barrier bilayer film pouches from corn zein and soy protein isolate for olive oil packaging.xml,['abstract']," An edible oxygen barrier film pouch was fabricated from a heat sealable corn zein (CZ) layer laminated on soy protein isolate (SPI) film and used to package olive oil condiments for use with instant noodles. The mechanical, barrier, and physical properties of the CZ / SPI bilayer films were then investigated and the oxidative stability of olive oil in the pouches was measured during storage under dry and intermediate relative humidity conditions. When compared to the SPI film, lamination with an additional layer of CZ film led to increased tensile strength and water barrier properties, while it had a lower elongation at break and decreased oxygen barrier properties. Nevertheless, the oxygen permeability of the CZ / SPI film (0.81 × 10^-18 m^3 m / m^2 s Pa) was lower than that of nylon-metalocene catalyzed linear low-density polyethylene (NY / mLLDPE) film (3.51 × 10^-18 m^3 m / m^2 s Pa) which is the material usually used for such condiments. The CZ / SPI bilayer films generated here were heat sealable at 120-130 °C and produced a seal strength greater than 300 N / m. The higher oxygen barrier property of the CZ / SPI bilayer films resulted in reduced oxidative rancidity of olive oil packaged in the CZ / SPI film when compared to olive oil packaged in NY / mLLDPE films.

442,Edible oxygen barrier bilayer film pouches from corn zein and soy protein isolate for olive oil packaging.xml,['Introduction']," Convenience foods enable the consumer to save time and energy associated with food-related activities such as shopping, meal preparation, cooking, and consumption (Buckley, Cowan, & McCarthy, 2007). Among the convenience foods, instant noodles have become very popular due to their reasonable price and ease of preparation. As the standard of living has increased, instant noodle products with improved organoleptic and nutritional qualities have gained popularity. Often, edible vegetable oils such as olive oil are added to instant noodles to improve the flavor. Such added oils have generally been provided in a separately packaged plastic film pouches designed for single usage. However, packaged oil condiments are susceptible to lipid oxidation since plastic films offer only limited protection against oxygen transmission. Lipid oxidation not only causes an off-flavor in oil condiments that leads to decreased organoleptic quality, but they also produce several by-products those are potentially toxic to human such as malonaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal (Fujioka and Shibamoto, 2004, Kanavouras et al., 2006). Additionally, direct contact of the oil and films for sufficient lengths of time has been found to result in the transfer of additives originally incorporated in the plastic films into the oil condiments; therefore, there is the potential for additives to threaten the health of the consumer. In addition, there are a number of drawbacks associated with the using plastic film pouches for packaging oil condiments including; (1) the generation of waste associated with the materials used to package convenience foods; (2) tearing the pouches during the application of oil condiments to the food may cause reduced convenience; (3) leftover oil may remain in the pouch after application to food. Edible packaging materials produced from natural products may provide an alternative to the problem of disposing of plastic materials. Among biopolymers, soy protein produces films that are more flexible, smooth, water soluble, and clear than those produced by other plant protein sources (Brandenburg, Weller, & Testin, 1993). Soy protein-based edible films have received considerable attention due to their excellent film forming abilities, low cost and barrier properties against oxygen permeation under dry RH conditions (Rhim, Mohanty, Singh, & Ng, 2006). However, there are some limitations to the application of soy protein-based films for packaging due to their poor mechanical properties and heat sealability compared to synthetic polymer films such as LDPE and polyester film. In general, the tensile strength (TS) of soy protein films range between 3 and 9 MPa which varies with the plasticizers used and environmental RH, whereas TS of LDPE films and polyester films had 9-17 MPa and 175 MPa, respectively (Krochta, 2002). In addition, heat sealability of soy protein film has not been reported yet (Su et al., 2010). The properties of protein-based films can be improved by laminating additional film layers with desired film properties such as corn zein films (Ghanbarzadeh and Oromiehi, 2009, Pol et al., 2002). Corn zein produces a film with high tensile strength and low water vapor permeabilities when compared to other protein-based films, and the resulting films have desirable heat seal characteristics (Cho et al., 2002, Park et al., 1996). It is also expected that the lamination of corn zein layers onto soy protein isolate films will produce oxygen barrier bilayer films that will enable pouches to be readily formed by heat sealing of the corn zein layer. In the present study, the corn zein layer laminated soy protein isolate (CZ / SPI) films were produced, and the mechanical, barrier, and physical properties such as solubility in hot water and heat sealability of CZ / SPI film was investigated and compared with those of the synthetic films. The film solubility in hot water is a very important characteristic of the protein-based films because the films needed to be disintegrated during cooking and release the oil from the pouches for improved convenience. A nylon layer laminated metalocene catalyzed linear low-density polyethylene (NY / mLLDPE) film was used as the control synthetic film, that is currently used for the package of oil condiments used in instant noodles. And also the potential application of CZ / SPI films to produce an oxygen barrier pouch was evaluated based on the oxidative stabilities of olive oil in the pouches during storage under dry and intermediate relative humidity (RH) conditions.

459,Edible oxygen barrier bilayer film pouches from corn zein and soy protein isolate for olive oil packaging.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Mechanical and barrier properties of the bilayer films']"," The mechanical properties (TS and E values) and barrier properties (WVP and OP values) of the bilayer films are presented in Table 2. The application of a relatively thin layer of corn zein to form a CZ / SPI bilayer film resulted in a more than two-fold increase in the TS value (5.9 MPa). In addition, the E value of SPI decreased drastically to 7.3% after production of the CZ / SPI bilayer film. The low E value of the CZ / SPI bilayer film was attributed to the limited stretchability of the PEG plasticized corn zein film at 50% RH (Lawton, 2004). In general, the mechanical properties of films are affected by the type and amount of plasticizer incorporated into the film, with the E value increasing and the TS values and barrier properties decreasing as the amount of plasticizer increases. The CZ / SPI film with 7.3% elongation was not brittle and had a film integrity that was acceptable for pouch fabrication, although the TS and E values of the CZ / SPI film were much lower than those of the NY / mLLDPE control films. The WVP and OP are measures of barrier properties of CZ / SPI bilayer films against moisture and oxygen movement across the membrane, respectively. The WVP and OP of the NY / mLLDPE film were used as a reference for comparison of the moisture and oxygen barrier property. Although the moisture barrier properties of the CZ / SPI bilayer film were still lower than those of the NY / mLLDPE film, the WVP of the SPI film layer was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced when an additional CZ film layer was introduced. In general, the WVP of laminated film is determined by the thickness and WVP values of each film layer comprising the laminated film (Cho et al., 2002). Films produced using CZ have an extraordinarily high hydrophobicity when compared to other plant protein films due to the high content of hydrophobic amino acids in CZ (Fu, Weller, & Wehling, 1999). The decrease in WVP value in response to lamination of the CZ film layer was attributed to the low WVP value of the CZ film layer. CZ film layers have also been used to reduce the WVP of biodegradable hydrophilic films including starch (Ryu, Rhim, Roh, & Kim, 2002), and whey protein isolates (Ghanbarzadeh & Oromiehi, 2009). The OP of the CZ / SPI film is very important because it determines the amount of lipid oxidation of packaged olive oil that occurs, which is the primary determinant of quality. The OP of the SPI film and CZ / SPI bilayer film measured at 50% RH were 0.60 × 10^-18 m^3 m / m^2 s Pa and 0.81 × 10^-18 m^3 m / m^2 s Pa, respectively (Table 2). The OP of the SPI film used in the present study was comparable to the previously reported OP values of SPI film measured at 50% RH (Cho et al., 2007, Rhim et al., 2006). It is well known that SPI films show extremely low OP values under dry RH conditions and that the OP of SPI films at 0% RH were about 70% lower than those of corn zein films formed under similar conditions (Brandenburg et al., 1993, Gennadios et al., 1993). The OP of hydrophilic protein films are susceptible to environmental RH conditions, and increase exponentially as the RH increases beyond intermediate RH conditions (Rhim et al., 2006). The application of an additional layer of lower oxygen barrier CZ film and an elevated RH was found to have an adverse effect on the OP of the CZ / SPI bilayer film. Despite these drawbacks, the CZ / SPI bilayer film still had higher oxygen barrier properties than the NY / mLLDPE film (3.51 × 10^-18 m^3 m / m^2 s Pa) and other plastic films including the LDPE (216.44 × 10^-18 m^3 m / m^2 s Pa) and HDPE (49.42 × 10^-18 m^3 m / m^2 s Pa) films (Rhim et al., 2006).

The disintegration of pouch increases the convenience of releasing oil condiment into food system. As shown in Fig. 2, approximately 50% of the CZ / SPI film dissolved when placed in hot water (90 °C) for 150 s. The partially dissolved bilayer film easily disintegrated, thereby releasing the olive oil. Additionally, the dissolution speed of the bilayer film accelerated as the water temperature increased for each film sample. Su, Huang, Yang, and Yuan (2008) reported that an SPI film completely dissolved within 180 s when placed in 100 °C hot water. The relatively lower water solubility of the bilayer film in the present study could be attributed the less hydrophilic nature of the corn zein film. "

The seal strengths of the CZ / SPI bilayer films were measured for film specimens that were heat sealed at temperatures ranging from 85 to 155 °C, and the resulting seal strengths ranged from 25 to 345 N / m. The seal strengths of the films were primarily affected by the heat sealing temperature. Specifically, 120-130 °C was found to be the optimal temperature range for sealing the corn zein layer. Indeed, seals formed in the optimal temperature range had a strength of 330 N / m, while those formed at other temperatures had a strength of less than 165 N / m. The heat sealing temperature of a protein film is closely related to its thermal transition temperature. This is because the sealing temperature of a polymer is typically conducted near the onset temperature of thermal transition, which is a function of the amount of moisture and plasticizer in the film (Hernandez-Izquierdo et al., 2008, Kim and Ustunol, 2001). The decreased strength of seals formed above 130 °C was due to excessive heat treatment, which resulted in a distorted or nonfunctional seal (Kim & Ustunol, 2001). The seals were also visualized by SEM analysis (Fig. 4). A cross-sectional view of the heat-sealed CZ / SPI films showed that the films heat sealed at 80 °C separated due to insufficient heat treatment, while the zein film layer of pouches sealed at 160 °C were deformed due to excessive heat.

The oxidative stabilities of the oil samples determined by measuring the peroxide values (POV) during storage are shown in Fig. 5. The POV of NMP oil stored at 50 °C increased as the storage time increased. Specifically, during 90 days of storage at 50 °C, the POV of NMP oil increased from 9.05 meq / kg to 104.5-116.3 meq / kg, and an additional 30 days of storage led to a drastic increase in POV to 250-300 meq / kg. The oxidative stabilities of vegetable oils are affected by the environmental RH and oxygen level (Maté, Saltveit, & Krochta, 1996). The rates of oxidation in vegetable oil are accelerated at high RH because more water molecules can act as reaction media, while the rates of oxidation are higher at RH values below the monolayer moisture content because the oil is directly exposed to external oxygen (Partanen et al., 2008). However, in the present study, the environmental RH did not have a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the rancidity of NPP oil samples stored at 32-52% RH. This was probably due to the uniform oxygen permeability of the plastic films under a wide range of RH conditions and to the constant RH of the inside headspace in the package that was produced by the high barrier properties of the NY / mLLDPE film against the movement of moisture across the membrane (Table 2). The CSP oil showed a reduced increase in POV when compared to NMP oil during 120 days of storage. The POV of CPS oil after 120 days of storage at 50 °C and varying environmental RH ranged from 54 to 93 meq / kg. During the early stages of storage, lipid oxidation is propagated by consuming oxygen in the headspace of the pouch. The loss of oxygen in the pouch causes movement of oxygen across the film toward the inside of the packaging, which provides substrates for oxidation. Protein films are generally good barriers against oxygen at low and intermediate RH (Javanmard, 2008). The higher oxygen barrier property of CZ / SPI bilayer films resulted in a lower oxygen concentration in the pouch headspace than in the NY / mLLDPE film pouches, which led to reduced lipid rancidity in CSP oil. Unlike NMP oil, the POV of CSP oil was affected by the environmental RH, and this RH dependence of POV was attributed to increased oxygen permeability of hydrophilic biopolymer films under elevated RH conditions. Moisture has a plasticizing and swelling effect on protein-based films that may result in elevated oxygen permeability. Additionally, an exponential effect of RH on the OP of hydrophilic films has been reported for protein-based films subjected to high RH conditions (Hong and Krochta, 2006, Tomasula et al., 2003). In this study, the packaging of olive oil in the CZ / SPI bilayer film pouch was found to control lipid rancidity under practical storage conditions with dry and intermediate RH ranges. "

In addition, the high moisture barrier properties of the CZ / SPI bilayer film under dry and intermediate RH conditions may extend the shelf life of olive oil by preventing oxidative rancidity during storage.

471,Effect of an organo-modified montmorillonite on PLA crystallization and gas barrier properties.xml,['abstract'], Amorphous nanocomposite films were prepared from melt-blending of polylactide (PLA) and an organo-modified montmorillonite (O-MMT). The filler amount was varied in the range from 0 to 8 wt.% . The gas permeability decrease measured as a function of the clay content was accurately described by Nielsen law. The influence of O-MMT was studied on PLA non isothermal and isothermal crystallisation. The incorporation of small amounts of OMMTs within PLA favoured the polymer matrix crystallisation by decreasing the cold crystallisation temperature for heating thermal treatments and the crystallisation half-time for isothermal ones. Optimised annealing conditions allowing to obtain high crystallinity degrees combined with high melting crystalline lamellae were proposed. The permeability decrease observed for the annealed nanocomposite with respect to the amorphous reference PLA film was shown to result from the respective contribution of the clays and the crystalline phase.

478,Effect of an organo-modified montmorillonite on PLA crystallization and gas barrier properties.xml,['Introduction']," The need for the development of biodegradable polymeric materials became obvious for a wide range of applications, especially for packaging. Indeed the environmental impact of petrochemical-based polymers and the waste management constitute an increasing concern. Polymers derived from renewable sources have then become a subject of increased interest and natural polymers such as starch or chitosan have been widely studied (Chivrac et al., 2008, Despond et al., 2005, Dole et al., 2004, Masclaux et al., 2010, Raquez et al., 2008). During the last decades, polylactide (PLA), a polymer derived from lactic acid has become an emergent bio-based polymer since it combines different advantages (Auras et al., 2003, Auras et al., 2004, Degée and Dubois, 2004, Gorrasi et al., 2008, Tsuji et al., 2006): i) it can be obtained from a renewable agricultural source (corn), its production consumes carbon dioxide, it is recyclable and compostable i.i) it can be processed by injection moulding, sheet extrusion, thermoforming and cast solution film forming i.i.i) its hydrophilicity is limited and its mechanical properties can be modulated through the polymer architecture and morphology. However, PLA exhibits low gas barrier properties (Auras et al., 2003, Auras et al., 2004, Bao et al., 2006, Chang et al., 2003, Lehermeier et al., 2001, Ray et al., 2003a, Ray et al., 2003b) and it is a slowly crystallising polymer. As polymer crystalline phase is considered to be impermeable to small molecules, it is very important to optimise PLA crystallisation conditions to improve its barrier properties. Some inorganic fillers, such as talc, have been shown to play a role on PLA crystallisation by increasing the nucleation density and decreasing the crystallisation half-time and the time to complete crystallisation (Kolstad, 1996, Li and Huneault, 2007). In this way, it could be very interesting to combine a nucleation effect of the fillers with a specific role of these fillers on the gas barrier properties. Lamellar nanofillers with a high aspect ratio such as montmorillonites represent good candidates for this tool. Indeed these fillers have been widely used to decrease the gas barrier properties by a tortuosity effect (Bharadwaj, 2001, Gain et al., 2005, Messersmith and Giannelis, 1995, Picard et al., 2007, Takahashi et al., 2006, Zeppa et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2010) but only few results have been reported on PLA / clay systems (Chang et al., 2003, Ray et al., 2003a, Ray et al., 2003b). Furthermore, some studies (Nam et al., 2003, Ogata et al., 1997, Pluta, 2004, Wu et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2008) tend to show that PLA crystallisation kinetics can be modified in the presence of clays. However, if most of the studies based on PLA / montmorillonites are mainly focused on thermal or mechanical properties (Ogata et al., 1997, Pluta, 2004), according to our knowledge, no study has been concerned with crystallisation-permeability relationships in PLA nanocomposites. This paper aims at investigating the influence of an organically modified montmorillonite on the crystallisation and on the gas barrier properties of PLA. Amorphous reference PLA and nanocomposite films are first prepared for a wide range of fillers (0 to 8 wt.% ) to discuss the role of the nanoclays on the amorphous film gas transport properties. The crystallisation of pure PLA and PLA nanocomposite films is then studied to afterward highlight the role of the lamellar nanofillers on the PLA crystallisation for different isothermal and non-isothermal crystallisation conditions. Optimised annealing conditions are determined and the gas transport properties of the annealed PLA and nanocomposite films are discussed. "

The interplatelet distance was equal to 18 Å. In this filler, the organic and inorganic weight fractions were equal to 30.8% and 69.2% , respectively. "
480,Effect of an organo-modified montmorillonite on PLA crystallization and gas barrier properties.xml,"['Experimental', 'Nanocomposite preparation']"," PLA / OMMT nanocomposites were prepared by melt compounding the polymer and the clays using a DSM mini-extruder. Compounding was carried out under nitrogen at a barrel temperature of 200 °C and a screw speed of 60 rpm. The residence time was equal to 20 min. Two blends containing 3.8 and 7.9 filler weight percents were prepared. They are referred as PLANC4 and PLANC8, respectively. Unfilled PLA was also melt-processed in the same conditions to prepare a reference material, denoted PLA. As a matter of fact, it is important to study the effect of the formulation from samples which underwent exactly the same thermal history, including the extrusion step otherwise some behaviour differences may be erroneously attributed to the formulation. Then 100 μm thick films were prepared from each compound by compression moulding at 200 °C. As PLA is very sensitive to hydrolysis during melt processing, it is worth noting that all materials (PLA granulars, nanofillers but also the compounds) were intensively dried (at least 4 h in a vacuum oven at 110 °C) before each processing step (melt compounding and compression moulding, respectively). It is also important to be precise that no significant decrease of the PLA molecular weight was recorded between the PLA granulars and the different PLA based films by size exclusion chromatography.

Samples of about 10 mg were taken from each film and they were placed in an aluminium pan. Experiments consisting in non isothermal analyses and isothermal cold crystallisation analyses were performed on the samples. For non isothermal analyses, the first step consisted in melting the samples at 200 °C during 5 min to erase its thermal history (Kawamoto et al., 2007, Sanchez et al., 2005). The temperature was decreased from 200 °C to 20 °C at 20 °C / min in order to obtain amorphous samples. Then it was increased at different heating rates (from 1 to 20 °C / min). For isothermal cold crystallisation experiments, the samples were heated from 20 °C to the desired crystallisation temperature (90, 100, 110 and 120 °C, respectively) at 20 °C / min. The heat flow was then monitored until it became constant indicating the apparent end of the crystallisation. Then, the temperature was decreased at 20 °C / min down to 20 °C. A heating scan at 10 °C / min was then carried out in order to observe the corresponding melting peak. In these different experiments, the glass transition temperature, Tg, was determined as the onset of the baseline change. The melting temperature, Tm, and the crystallisation temperature, Tc, were determined as the maximum of the melting peak and of the crystallisation peak, respectively. Both isothermal and non isothermal crystallisation experiments were characterised by the variation of the heat flux. In particular, for isothermal experiments, the relative crystallinity, α(t), was calculated through the ratio of the crystallisation peak area before time t over its total area. The half crystallisation time t1 / 2 was obtained for a relative crystallinity α = 0.5. For all treatment types, the crystallinity index, Xc, was determined from the heating scan following the treatment: the considered enthalpy was the result of the subtraction between the enthalpies of the endothermic peaks and the eventual exothermic ones. For the nanocomposite films, this enthalpy value was normalised to the amount of PLA. The crystallinity was calculated by dividing the obtained enthalpy by the enthalpy of the infinite crystal ΔHf∞ = 93 J / g (Kalb and Pennings, 1980, Kawamoto et al., 2007, Sanchez et al., 2005). "

It should be added that this expression for the relative crystallinity is based on the assumption that the transmitted light intensity can be considered proportional to the crystallinity. Nevertheless, even if this assumption is very strong, previous comparisons with scanning calorimetry results obtained with polypropylene showed a good agreement between the results (Koscher and Fulchiron, 2002).

A preliminary high vacuum desorption was realised during at least 48 h to ensure that the static vacuum pressure changes in the downstream compartment were smaller than the pressure changes due to the gas diffusion. The gases were introduced in the upstream compartment under a pressure of 3 bars. The pressure variations in the downstream compartment were recorded as a function of time with a Datametrics pressure sensor. A steady-state line was obtained after a transitory state.

The time lag was high enough to be considered with a good accuracy for oxygen. For helium, gas of a small kinetic diameter, the time lag value was too small to be measured with a good confidence and the diffusion coefficient could not be calculated.

487,Effect of an organo-modified montmorillonite on PLA crystallization and gas barrier properties.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Morphology of the reference PLA and nanocomposite films']"," The X-ray diffraction pattern of the organomodified montmorillonite is shown in Fig. 1a and the X-ray diffraction patterns of the PLA, PLANC4 and PLANC8 reference films are presented in Fig. 1b. The well defined halo observed for all films in the 2θ range from 9 ° to 30 ° is the contribution of the amorphous PLA phase. No diffraction peaks relative to a polymer crystalline phase is observed on the X-ray diffraction patterns showing that amorphous PLA films are initially obtained. The diffraction peaks observed in the 2θ range from 1 ° to 10 ° on the patterns of the nanocomposites are related to the clay dispersion state within the PLA matrix. A diffraction peak at 2θ = 5 ° (d001 = 17 Å) with a shoulder at 7 ° is observed in addition to a peak at 2θ around 2.5 ° (d001 = 34-36 Å). The intensity of the peaks centred at 5 and 7 ° does not depend on the clay content whereas the magnitude of the peak at 2.5 ° is higher for PLANC4 than for PLANC8. These results suggest that the composite morphology is complex. It probably results from a coexistence of exfoliated, intercalated and tactoid structures associated with a high degree of platelets or tactoid disorganization. The TEM images that are presented in Fig. 2 confirm these assumptions. Indeed tactoids of different width are observed in addition to exfoliated clays and the nanofiller dispersion cannot be considered as perfectly homogeneous. DSC analysis was performed in order to verify that PLA was totally amorphous in the reference films. The DSC thermograms obtained during a heating scan at 10 °C / min are shown in Fig. 3. The PLA glass transition, followed by the polymer crystallisation and the polymer melting can be observed on the thermograms of all samples. The DSC data are reported in Table 1. The glass transition temperature is practically equal to 58 °C for all the films. The shape of the DSC curves around the glass transition clearly indicates that the cooling conditions used to prepare the reference films induce an important physical ageing phenomenon. For PLA, the importance of this phenomenon was already reported (Hernandez Sanchez et al., 2005). Moreover, in all cases, the measured crystallisation enthalpy is equal to the melting enthalpy, showing that the reference films are amorphous. However, some differences are observed as a function of the film composition. In particular, the addition of nanofillers leads to a decrease of the cold crystallisation temperature (from 124 °C to 112 °C) and to a double subsequent melting peak (Tm1 = 148 °C and Tm2 = 155 °C, respectively). This preliminary analysis seems to show that OMMTs are able to significantly modify the PLA crystallisation and final crystalline morphology. These specific points will be discussed now more deeply in the particular case of isothermal and non isothermal crystallisation, respectively. "

492,Effect of an organo-modified montmorillonite on PLA crystallization and gas barrier properties.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Influence of the nanofillers on PLA crystallisation for different crystallisation conditions']"," In the non isothermal crystallisation experiments, the temperature was decreased from 200 °C to 20 °C at 20 °C / min to avoid any crystallisation phenomenon during cooling and then it was increased at a heating rate ranging from 1 to 20 °C / min. A cold crystallisation exotherm followed by a melting peak was observed on the heating scans. Tc and Tm values are reported in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, respectively. As commonly observed, Tc values increase for all systems as the heating rate becomes higher. The addition of a small amount of nanofillers leads to a systematic decrease in Tc value, confirming the nucleation effect induced by the nanoclays. A double melting peak is systematically observed for low heating rates whereas a lonely melting peak at a temperature intermediate between those of the double melting peaks, is observed for all the systems at a heating rate of 20 °C / min (Fig. 5). Each melting peak is the signature of a crystalline lamella population essentially characterised by its thickness and / or its perfection. Thus for the low heating rates, crystallisation occurs at lower temperature and the first and second melting peaks that are observed can be attributed to some crystallites formed during the cold crystallisation and some crystallites due to the melting / recrystallisation mechanism, respectively. As the heating rate increases, Tc increases. The thickness of the crystalline lamellae that are formed during cold crystallisation increases and recrystallisation becomes more difficult. A lonely melting peak is then observed and it is located at an intermediate temperature. According to Fig. 4, addition of nanofillers tends to decrease the cold crystallisation temperature, it is then not surprising to observe the presence of the two melting peaks for a larger range of heating rates (from 1 °C to 15 °C / min) in the case of the nanocomposite films in comparison with the neat PLA film. Indeed, a single melting peak is observed for PLA as soon as the heating rate becomes equal to 10 °C / min. The crystallinity values obtained after the cold crystallisation step have been reported in Fig. 6. A wide range of crystallinity values (from few percents to 35% ) can be achieved as a function of the film composition and heating rate. Whatever the film, a general trend is observed as a function of the heating rate: the crystallinity value is constant for low heating rates then it decreases as the heating rate increases. The nanofiller effect can be clearly evidenced from the curves. Indeed, if the maximum crystallinity of ~ 35% is practically not affected by the presence of the nanofiller, the OMMT effect on the crystallisation kinetics leads to the shift towards higher heating rates of the crystallinity decreasing. Thus, it can be concluded that OMMTs nanofillers promote the PLA crystallisation in non isothermal conditions especially at high heating rate. It was then interesting to study the effect of OMMTs on PLA crystallisation in isothermal conditions. The samples were heated from 20 °C to the desired crystallisation temperature (90, 100, 110 and 120 °C, respectively) at 20 °C / min. The variation of the heat flux was then measured as a function of the crystallisation time by DSC analysis whereas the evolution of the transmitted light intensity was followed by optical microscopy for experiments performed with the same thermal profile. The crystalline entities were too small to be observed by this last technique however both methods enabled the determination of the half time of crystallisation, t1 / 2. The obtained values of t1 / 2 for each film have been reported in Fig. 7. First, a good agreement is observed between the data obtained by both techniques. For all systems, the half crystallisation time decreases as the temperature increases in the range 90-110 °C. Then, between 110 ° and 120 °C, the beginning of an increase of t1 / 2 seems to be obtained. This U-shape for variation of t1 / 2 with the temperature is representative of the classical behaviour of the semi-crystalline polymers: in the lower temperature range (near Tg), the crystallisation is very slow because the molecular mobility is reduced. Moreover, in the highest temperature range (near Tm), the crystallisation is also slow because the thermodynamic driving force necessary to the nucleation and the lamellar growth is reduced. On the other hand, in the middle temperature range corresponding to a compromise between both mechanisms, the crystallisation kinetics presents a maximum which turns to a minimum in terms of crystallisation time. Besides, the addition of OMMTs within the PLA significantly increases the crystallisation rate whatever the annealing temperature. The melting temperatures characteristic of the crystalline phase formed during the different annealing treatments were then determined. A heating scan at 10 °C / min was performed after the isothermal crystallisation step. No residual crystallisation peak was detected on the thermogram, confirming that the crystallisation was completed during the isothermal treatment. A double melting peak was observed for the samples annealed at 90, 100 and 110 °C, whereas only a single melting peak was noticed after annealing at 120 °C. The evolution of the melting temperatures as a function of the crystallisation temperature is presented in Fig. 8. The temperature of the first melting peak, Tm1, increases when Tc increases. Thus, this first melting peak can be indubitably attributed to the crystalline lamellae formed during the annealing because the annealing temperature governs their thickness and subsequently, their melting temperature. For increasing annealing temperatures, the first melting peak tends to progressively merge with the second one. The temperature of the second melting peak, Tm2, is constant (154 °C) whatever the temperature at which the crystallisation has been performed. As for the previously presented DSC experiments at different heating rates, the second melting peak is attributed to the crystalline lamellae formed by the melting recrystallisation process occurring during the heating run. Therefore, since all the heating runs subsequent to the isothermal crystallisation experiments are performed at the same heating rate (10 °C / min), there is no reason that this melting temperature Tm2 changes. Moreover, the obtained polymer crystallinity increases as the crystallisation temperature increases (Fig. 9). No major differences are observed between the nanocomposites and PLA films annealed in the same conditions. Thus the isothermal annealing treatment at 120 °C seems to be particularly interesting as it leads to a high crystallinity degree as well as to more perfect and high-melting crystals for a rather low treatment duration. This treatment was then chosen in order to discuss the role of the crystallinity on the PLA and nanocomposite gas transport properties. "

499,Effect of an organo-modified montmorillonite on PLA crystallization and gas barrier properties.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Influence of the nanofillers and PLA crystallinity on the gas barrier properties']"," Helium and oxygen transport properties were determined at first on the PLA and nanocomposite reference films and then on the same films annealed during 20 min at 120 °C. The permeability and diffusion coefficients of each reference and annealed film are reported in Table 2. The main structural and morphological characteristics of these films, such as Tg and Xc values, were determined by DSC and are also given in Table 2. It was checked that the thermal treatment time at 120 °C was long enough to attain the highest crystallinity value. The analysis of the gas transport properties of the amorphous PLA, PLANC4 and PLANC8 reference films allows to study the sole effect of the clays on the gas diffusion. Whatever the diffusing molecule, i.e. helium or oxygen, the nanocomposites have improved gas barrier properties in comparison with the neat PLA film (Table 2). The gas barrier enhancement is higher than those reported by Ray et al., 2003a, Ray et al., 2003b on other PLA / organo-modified montmorillonites systems. Fig. 10 shows the evolution of the relative permeability and of the relative diffusion, i.e. the ratio of the nanocomposite property to that of neat PLA, as a function of the inorganic filler volume fraction. Whatever the gas, the relative permeability is significantly reduced by the addition of increasing amounts of OMMT. Considering the uncertainty on the gas transport property values (~ 5% ), it can be assumed that all the experimental points define a single curve (Fig. 10). A tortuosity effect is then at the origin of the permeability decrease. Nielsen law (Nielsen, 1967) was used to determine the filler theoretical mean aspect ratio, Lw, allowing the most accurate description of the experimental relative permeability curve (Fig. 10).(3)PncPPLA=1-ϕ1+L2wϕwhere Pnc is the permeability of the nanocomposite, PPLA, the permeability of the reference PLA film, L, the mean length of the nanofillers, w, the mean thickness of the fillers and ϕ, the inorganic nanofiller volume fraction. A good agreement between experimental and calculated curves is obtained for a mean filler aspect ratio value equal to 24 (Fig. 10). This value is in good agreement with the mean size of the fillers we have evidenced on the TEM micrographs. Thus, despite the non-optimised clay dispersion state, a significant increase in the gas barrier properties is observed for the amorphous nanocomposite films in comparison with the amorphous PLA film. The oxygen permeability and diffusion coefficients were also determined on the annealed PLA and PLANC4 films. The permeability and diffusion coefficients measured before and after annealing are compared in Fig. 11a and b, respectively. The gas barrier properties are highly improved as the PLA matrix crystallinity increases from 0 to 46% . The oxygen permeability is divided by a factor equal to 2.17 going from amorphous reference PLA to annealed PLA film. The combination of two factors can explain this result: a decrease of the gas diffusion rate since the formed polymer crystalline phase induces a tortuosity effect and a decrease of the oxygen solubility due to the high increase of the impermeable polymer crystalline fraction (from 0 to 46% ). Maxwell law (Peterlin, 1975) can be used to model the decrease of permeability in such systems. This law generally allows an appropriate description of the permeability as a function of the crystallinity in isotropic material. Maxwell law can be written as:(4)PSCPA=2(1-ϕc)2+ϕcwhere PSC is the permeability coefficient of the semi-crystalline polymer, PA, the permeability coefficient of the amorphous polymer and ϕc the impermeable crystalline fraction in the semi-crystalline polymer. According to Maxwell law, the permeability should decrease by a factor of 2.28 when the crystalline fraction increases from 0 to 0.46. Taking account of the uncertainty in permeability experimental measurements (5% ), a good agreement is then observed between the theoretical and experimental permeability decreases (Table 2). An additional effect of the clays is observed on the annealed nanocomposite films. Indeed the permeability of the annealed films decreases when the clay content increases from 0 to 3.7 wt.% . This permeability decrease cannot be assigned to the small difference observed between the crystallinity values of the annealed PLA and nanocomposite films. It can only be related to a nanofiller tortuosity effect. Indeed the relative diffusion and the relative permeability values calculated from the gas transport properties of annealed PLA and annealed nanocomposite are equal, i.e. 0.87, and this value is similar to those we had calculated from amorphous PLA and PLANC4 film properties (Fig. 10). Thus the nanofillers play the same role in the amorphous and semi-crystalline films. This result is not surprising as the crystallisation occurs from glassy state. Thus the clay dispersion state can then not be significantly modified going from amorphous PLANC4 to semi crystalline PLANC4 films. In conclusion, the permeability decrease observed for the annealed nanocomposite with respect to the amorphous reference PLA film results from the contribution of both the clays and the crystalline phase. According to our crystallisation studies, it would be possible to define thermal conditions in order to vary the crystallinity and the permeability values in a wide range. It would also be interesting to improve the nanofiller dispersion state in order to obtain a much higher nanoclay effect. These last points will constitute the aim of our further work. "

503,Effect of an organo-modified montmorillonite on PLA crystallization and gas barrier properties.xml,['Conclusion']," Amorphous nanocomposite films with intercalated nanostructure were prepared from melt-blending of PLA and an organo-modified montmorillonite. The filler amount was varied in the range from 0 to 8 wt.% . The gas permeability decrease observed as a function of the clay content was accurately described by Nielsen law. O-MMT had a strong effect on PLA non isothermal and isothermal crystallisation. The incorporation of small amounts of OMMTs within PLA decreased the cold crystallisation temperature for heating thermal treatments and the crystallisation half-time for isothermal ones. For non isothermal treatments, an increase of the PLA crystallinity was observed for the nanocomposite films in comparison with the respective PLA film, especially for high heating rates. For the same non isothermal crystallisation conditions, the presence of OMMTs often led to the formation of less perfect and lower-melting crystals due to the decrease of the cold crystallisation temperature. However, this difference in the final crystalline morphology was as less important as the crystallisation temperature increased. Optimised annealing conditions allowing to obtain high crystallinity degrees as well as high melting crystalline lamellae were deduced from these crystallisation studies. The permeability decrease observed for the annealed nanocomposite film containing 4 wt.% of montmorillonite with respect to the amorphous reference PLA film was shown to result from the respective contribution of the clays and of the polymer crystalline phase.

510,"Effect of clay content, homogenization RPM, pH, and ultrasonication on mechanical and barrier properties of fish gelatin montmorillonite nanocomposite films.xml",['Introduction']," Since the 1970s, environmental concerns have prompted several studies of different polar biopolymers as potential alternatives for synthetic polymers in the flexible packaging industries (Garcia, Martino, & Zaritzky, 2000). Numerous studies have been conducted investigating the properties of various protein, polysaccharide, and lipid-based biopolymer materials. These materials have been successfully formed into films or coatings (Chen, 1995, Gontard et al., 1996, Kim et al., 2002, Park and Chinnan, 1995, Park et al., 1993). Natural biopolymers have the advantage of being biodegradable, renewable, and often edible. However, biopolymer films have exhibited relatively poor mechanical and water vapor barrier properties when compared to traditional polymeric films, therefore limiting their commercial use. Also, the use of additives such as plasticizers, which are necessary to achieve flexible films, affect barrier properties (McHugh & Krochta, 1994). Due to their inherent hydrophilic properties, biopolymer films absorb large quantities of water at elevated relative humidity (RH) conditions, resulting in plasticized film matrices that have weakened barrier and mechanical properties (Lim, Mine, & Tung, 1999). Numerous studies have been conducted in an effort to improve the properties of biopolymer films utilizing a variety of modifications (Chen et al., 2003, Uresti et al., 2003). Even after such modifications, the physical and mechanical properties of these biopolymer films can still be inadequate for many applications. Gelatin is a complex polypeptide widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, photographic, and cosmetic manufacturing. Gelatin was one of the initial materials used for the formation of biopolymer films and continues to be used in edible film studies given the abundance of raw material, low production cost, global availability, and excellent film forming properties (Vanin, Sobral, Menegalli, Carvalho, & Habitante, 2005). Traditional sources of gelatin have been primarily pig skin and cowhide, however for a number of reasons such as religious prohibition and concerns over the spreading of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), alternatives for these mammalian based gelatins are in increasing demand. Among the many possible alternatives, the characteristics and properties of fish gelatin have been studied in recent years as a potential mammalian gelatin alternative (Yi, Kim, Bae, Whiteside, & Park, 2006). One of the limitations of fish gelatin is that it has relatively low gelling and melting temperatures along with poor mechanical properties when compared to mammalian gelatin. This is primarily due to the fact that fish gelatin contains lower amounts of the proline and hydroxyproline. (Bower et al., 2006, Yi et al., 2006) Recently, the emerging research area of polymer nanocomposites has received great interest due to the ability of nano-sized material fillers to significantly improve polymer properties when compared with polymer alone or micro-scale composites. The potential improvements include enhanced mechanical strength, weight reduction, increased heat-resistance and improved barrier properties. (Ray & Okamoto, 2003) The enhanced mechanical properties of polymer / nanoclay composite films have attracted a great deal of research focus (Krook et al., 2005, Rao and Pochan, 2007, Usuki, 1995). Among studied minerals, the expanding 2:1 type layer silicates, of which montmorillonite is an example, were of particular interest in view of their ability to intercalate a huge list of compounds (Ruiz-Hitzky, Darder, & Aranda, 2005). A relatively small amount of nanoclay, typically in the range of 3-5 wt% , can produce significant improvements in the mechanical and thermal properties of the nanoclay / polymer nanocomposites. (Lam, Lau, Cheung, & Ling, 2005) Product development of these type of composites have increased globally. For example, a Toyota research group showed improvement in the thermal and mechanical properties of a polyamide 6-montmorrilonite composite material (Krook et al., 2005, Usuki, 1995). In this research, fish gelatin was combined with layered silicates, specifically homoionic smectites (Na-montmorillonite), in order to enhance the mechanical properties and the barrier properties against oxygen and water vapor. Research has shown that two factors, the intercalation of the clay sheets and the dispersion of the intercalated platelets, determine the change in properties (Rao, 2007). The resulting fish gelatin-nanoclay composite film was characterized according to the clay content, amount of shear force applied at pretreatment of clay solution, pH, and ultrasonication applied at pretreatment of clay solution.

On the basis of viscosity observations, the temperature of 40 °C was selected for fish gelatin-nanoclay composite film preparation and subsequent analyses due to the convenience in preparing film samples using casting method.

The effects of composite formation are reflected in the mechanical property improvements, where the most significant improvement in TS is observed in the 5 g clay / 100 g gelatin sample (Fig. 2a). Results indicated that increasing the clay content increased the TS of composite film and made the films more brittle. The control gelatin film had TS of 30.31±2.37 MPa. The TS of clay composite generally increased (40.71±3.30 MPa) up to 5 g clay / 100 g gelatin, and leveling out, with a slight dip at 7 g clay / 100 g gelatin. At 9 g clay / 100 g gelatin, TS of the composite film was higher than that of gelatin control film. Increasing the clay content dropped the EB of the fish gelatin-clay composite film.

It can be seen that the TS is the highest at lower pH values. The highest levels of TS and EB were observed at a pH of 5. Further increases in pH of the film solution decreased the TS and E% . The TS decreased from 19.66±3.02 MPa (pH 4) to 13.04±1.38 MPa (pH 9) and the E% decreased from 46.69±8.41% (pH 4) to 34.33±6.91% (pH 9). At pH 7, a significant decrease of TS (12.89±1.38 MPa) was observed. In the case of EB, a significant decrease (36.36±7.64) was observed at pH 6. The solubility of proteins is the lowest near their isoelectric point (pI) since intramolecular electrostatic interactions would be maximal at this point, causing the dipolar molecule to adopt the most compact conformation. It can be suggested that the increase of electrostatic interactions decreased contacts between protein and nanoclay and therefore resulted in decreased mechanical properties at pI (pH 6∼7) of fish gelatin. These findings are consistent with other reported work. Research has shown that the intercalation of gelatin in Na-homoionic smectites occurs at low pH values, which are necessary to protonate amino groups belonging to the amino acids of the protein. Thus, the positively charged gelatin is able to replace totally or partially the sodium ions which are mainly located on the interlayer space of the smectites (Ruiz-Hitzky et al., 2005). It has been remarked earlier by Ensminger and Gieseking, 1939, Ensminger and Gieseking, 1941 that complex formation between protein and montmorillonite primarily involved an exchange between the cationic (-NH3^+) groups on the amino acid side chains of the protein and the Na^+ ion occupying exchange sites at the montmorillonite surface. Mclaren, Peterson, and Barshad (1958) studied the reactions of gelatin dissolved in buffer solutions of different pH and ionic strength, with Na-montmorrilonite suspensions. They found that the process was characterized by determining the adsorption isotherms for the gelatin in function of pH and relating the basal spacing of the resulting complexes to the amount adsorbed. They reported decrease in adsorption at pH > pI which can be ascribed to electrostatic repulsion between the protein anion and the negatively charged montmorillonite surface. Moreover, this effect is further enhanced by the cations in solution (e.g. Na^+) competing with the protein for the surface. "

In the blends, the unmodified sodium montmorillonite clay was initially treated with a high-powered ultrasonication in a solution of glycerol and distilled water. The nano-clay solution was then added to a fish gelatin solution and casted using a mechanical film caster. This ultrasonically treated nanocomposite film exhibited an exfoliated type structure with improved tensile strength and barrier properties and the films produced were uniform in thickness and relatively transparent. The result gathered by XRD and TEM observations confirms that the majority of clay particles are in an exfoliated state. This study promotes the fact that clean ultrasonic energy contributes to the intercalation and exfoliation of unmodified montmorillonite clays. "

Milk packaged in coated paperboard cartons and stored under the same experimental conditions served as the “control” sample. Data were obtained for lipid oxidation, vitamin A and riboflavin content, microbial growth and sensory attributes (odour and taste). Results showed good protection of milk packaged in all packaging materials with regard to microbiological and chemical parameters assessed over the 7-day test period. Vitamin A losses recorded were 11% for multilayer and monolayer pigmented HDPE and pigmented PET bottles vs. 16% for the paperboard cartons and 31% for the clear PET bottles after 7 days of storage. Respective losses for riboflavin were 28% for the multilayer pigmented HDPE bottle and the paperboard carton, 30% for the monolayer pigmented HDPE bottle, 33% for the pigmented PET bottle and 40% for the clear PET bottle.

553,Effect of light transmittance and oxygen permeability of various packaging materials on keeping quality of low fat pasteurized milk.xml,['Introduction']," The main factors affecting the keeping quality of pasteurized milk are raw milk quality, severity of heat treatment, post-pasteurization contamination and storage temperature (IDF, 1986). Packaging is also a factor of utmost importance effectively protecting the product from microbial recontamination, light and oxygen (Hoskin, 1988; Bosset, Gallmann, & Sieber, 1993; Ravanis & Lewis, 1995; Erickson, 1997; Skibsted, 2000; Borle, Sieber, & Bosset, 2001; Vassila, Badeka, Kondyli, Savvaidis, & Kontominas, 2002). Milk quality deterioration is perceived by the consumer through off-flavours that may be caused by both feeding conditions of the animal with certain pastures (Palmquist, Beaulieu, & Barbano, 1993) or chemical, physicochemical or microbiological changes in the product itself (Thomas, 1981; Allen & Joseph, 1985; Rysstad, Ebbesey, & Eggestad, 1998; Valero, Villamiel, Sanz, & Martinez-Castro, 2000; Van Aardt, Duncan, Marcy, Long, & Hachey, 2001). Among these defects, light-induced off-flavours are probably the most common in milk attributed to two distinct causes. The first, a “burnt sunlight flavour” develops during the first 2 or 3 days of storage and is caused by degradation products of sulfur containing amino acids of the whey proteins (Marsili, 1999) mainly methional (Borle et al., 2001). The second is a metallic or cardboardy off-flavour that develops 2 days later and does not dissipate. This off-flavour is attributed to lipid oxidation (Barnard, 1972). Light exposure especially to wavelengths below 500 nm also causes destruction of light sensitive vitamins, mainly riboflavin and vitamin A (Sattar, de Man, & Alexander, 1977; Fanelli, Burlew, & Gabriel, 1985; Borle et al., 2001). Packaging can directly prevent the development of light-induced flavour by protecting the product from both light and oxygen (Schröder, 1982; Skibsted, 2000; Borle et al., 2001; Vassila et al., 2002). Apart from traditional glass bottles and coated paperboard cartons all-plastics containers have been used in pasteurized milk packaging (Schröder, Scott, Bland, & Bishop, 1985; Defosse, 2000). Problems with all-plastics containers used in numerous studies mentioned above, include light transmission and oxygen permeability. It should be noted, however, that oxidative reactions (autooxidation) were reported to take place in milk packaged even in coated paperboard cartons which were found to be more or less permeable to oxygen (Schröder et al., 1985; Rysstad et al., 1998). More recently, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and coextruded HDPE bottles have been used for fresh milk packaging (Bakish & Hatfield, 1997; Cladman, Scheffer, Goodrich, & Griffiths, 1998; Van Aardt et al., 2001). PET has excellent mechanical properties, a good barrier to oxygen and reduces the adverse effects of light on milk quality in the form of pigmented bottles. On the other hand pigmented HDPE bottles both monolayer and multilayer, at a higher thickness than PET bottles, are finding their way into the fresh milk packaging market. Both provide excellent convenience through easy opening and reclosing, minimizing recontamination (Cladman et al., 1998). The objective of this study was to evaluate chemical and sensory stability of low fat milk packaged in PET and HDPE bottles with different light and oxygen barriers as compared to that provided by the coated paperboard carton under actual commercial conditions of storage.

566,Effect of light transmittance and oxygen permeability of various packaging materials on keeping quality of low fat pasteurized milk.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Chemical assessment of milk quality', 'Lipid oxidation']"," All milk samples showed a similar pattern of lipid oxidation over the 7 day storage period despite differences (p<0.05) exhibited by individual samples (Fig. 1). As expected the oxidation level generally increased gradually with time in all samples. Between day 1 and day 7 of storage, milk packaged in PET (clear and pigmented) exhibited a higher degree of lipid oxidation (p<0.05) than in the other packages. It is obvious that in the clear PET the effect of light was more pronounced than in pigmented materials. The higher degree of lipid oxidation recorded for the pigmented PET as compared to the pigmented HDPE bottles may be attributed to the much higher thickness of the latter (300-350 vs. 550-600 μm) providing a better protection to the product against light. The longer the storage period, the higher the observed effect of light. What seems interesting is the fact that within the storage period tested and for the given packaging materials, oxygen permeability (Table 1) did not seem to influence degree of lipid oxidation in the product. Part of the explanation for this is the relatively large headspace (containing air), which was similar in all packages (25-40 mL) including the “control”. Dissolved, in the milk, oxygen values recorded (7.5, 6.6, 1.3, 0 mg L^-1 after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of storage, respectively) cannot account for this specific behaviour of the system. Present results are in general agreement with those of Cladman et al. (1998) who after 7 days of storage found thiobarbituric acid (TBA) scores of low fat milk in the range of 0.03 to 0.15 (Absorbance at λ=532 nm) for all packages tested. These authors reported however a significantly higher degree of lipid oxidation in milk packaged in HDPE jugs as compared to milk packaged in green PET bottles after 7 days of storage. A green colour has an extremely low protective (or filtering) effect on the photo-oxidation of milk due to the position of the 3rd absorption band of riboflavin in the visible range (λmax≅444 nm). To obtain a significant protection effect, it is necessary to use the complementary colour of the blue-green one, i.e. the red-brown (Borle et al., 2001). Obviously, the pigmented PET provided better protection to the product, with respect to light, than transparent HDPE. Likewise, Erickson (1997) reported a significantly higher degree of lipid oxidation for samples packaged in HDPE jugs as compared to samples packaged in paperboard cartons after 8 days of storage. The author attributed such differences to the light transmission properties of the packaging material (Hansen, Turner, & Aurand, 1975). "

Samples in both HDPE and pigmented PET bottles suffered a loss of vitamin A after 7 days of storage equal to 11% followed by control samples (16% loss) and finally by clear PET samples (31% loss). Based on O2 transmission values (Table 1) headspace volume (between 25 and 40 mL), dissolved oxygen values and headspace oxygen concentration values between 18% and 21% for the entire 7 day storage period (data not shown) it can be postulated that within the short life span of the experiment, oxygen was not a major factor in vitamin A degradation. It is interesting to note that pigmentation with 2% TiO2 was effective in preventing vitamin A degradation. Use of the high light barrier material consisting of the black pigment sandwiched between two white HDPE layers seemed to be unnecessary within the short life span of the product. This finding is in contrast to that of Vassila et al. (2002) who found better vitamin A protection in milk packaged in pigmented (20 g kg^-1 TiO2 / 40 g kg^-1 carbon black / 20 g kg^-1 TiO2) LDPE pouches than in pigmented (20 g kg^-1 TiO2) LDPE pouches. Such discrepancies may be interpreted in terms of thickness differences of packaging materials used (60-110 μm pouches vs. 550-600 μm bottles used in the present work). Fanelli et al. (1985) reported losses of vitamin A between 6% and 50% after milk exposure for 24 h with the best protection being achieved through the use of special UV blockers compounded into the HDPE resin used to manufacture plastic bottles.

Multilayer and monolayer pigmented HDPE, pigmented PET and “control” samples suffered a loss of riboflavin after 7 day of storage between 28% and 33% , while the clear PET sample suffered a loss of 40% . It is obvious that TiO2 pigmented bottles (both HDPE and PET) provided a better protection to riboflavin than the clear bottles (PET) since TiO2 pigmentation with or without carbon black pigmentation strongly reduced or even cut off light wavelengths between 400 and 500 nm (Fig. 4) which degrades riboflavin (Fanelli et al., 1985). The same authors reported losses of riboflavin between 57% and 70% already after 16 h of exposure using a variety of pigments and UV absorbers in their HDPE containers. De Man (1978) reported riboflavin losses after exposure of milk containers to fluorescent light for 48 h equal to 17% for paperboard cartons, 28% for clear PE pouches, 19% for HDPE jugs and 15% for jugs pigmented with 20 g kg^-1 TiO2. Hoskin and Dimick (1979) reported riboflavin losses after exposure of milk containers to fluorescent light for 72 h equal to 13% for clear PC (polycarbonate) bottles, 10% for HDPE bottles, 10% for paperboard cartons and 6% for PC tinted bottles. No significant loss of riboflavin was observed in milk held in the dark. Finally, Vassila et al. (2002) reported losses in vitamin B2 between 19% and 45% for whole milk after storage for 7 days in various plastic pouch materials. A final important point to be made is that the two main mechanisms of milk quality deterioration are chemical oxidation through O2 permeation and light-induced oxidation / vitamin degradation. The packaging material thickness (300-600 μm) effectively controlled the first mechanism while TiO2 and / or carbon black pigmentation controlled only the latter. "

586,"Effect of lignin on water vapor barrier, mechanical, and structural properties of agar-lignin composite films.xml",['Introduction']," Due to the environmental problems caused by non-biodegradable synthetic plastic packaging materials, research has focused to develop biodegradable packaging materials using the renewable resource based natural polymers. Currently, the uses of natural biopolymers such as starch, protein, and cellulose have been increased to develop biodegradable food packaging films [1]. Natural biopolymers are environmental friendly and offer a variety of applications that have the advantages over conventional plastic. However, inherent limitations of natural biopolymer-based packaging materials such as low mechanical and water resistant properties are causing a major restriction for their industrial use. These problems have been overcome by blending or reinforcing plasticizers and crosslinking agents into biopolymers [2], [3]. Consequently, natural biopolymer-based packaging materials with multifunctional properties have a high potential for their application in the active food packaging industry [4], [5]. To achieve multi-functional properties of biopolymer films, fillers have been used widely in developing food packaging films [6], [7]. So far, many natural biopolymers were used to develop packaging materials such as starch, soy protein, whey protein, alginate, and carboxymethyl cellulose [8]. Among them, agar is one of the most important biopolymers that has been recently used in the food industry, especially for packaging due to their renewability and biodegradability with good film-forming properties. However, agar-based films are brittle in nature with low mechanical and thermal properties. Therefore, the glycerol was used as a plasticizer to reduce the brittleness of the films, and to make them flexible [9]. Reports are available for blending fillers like nano clay, nanocellulose, grapefruit seed extract, and metallic nanoparticles to improve the mechanical and functional properties of agar based biocomposite films [10], [11], [12]. Among biopolymers, nanocellulose has been widely used as reinforcing material to improve the properties of biocomposite films [10], [13]. However, few reports are available on lignin as a reinforcing agent in biopolymer [14], [15]. Lignin is the second most abundant material available on the earth next to cellulose. Lignin is a complex phenolic compound found abundantly in the cell wall of plants in association with cellulose and hemicellulose [16]. Fig. 1 shows the chemical structure of lignin. Owing to the complex phenolic structure of lignin, it possesses strong antioxidant activity, which give an additional functional property to the biopolymer. Hussin et al. [17] proved the antioxidant property of lignin with different chemical treatments. Núñez-Flores et al. [15] reinforced lignin into gelatin polymer and reported the strong antioxidant property of gelatin / lignin biocomposite. Liu et al. [18] developed the copolymer films with lignin as an ultraviolet light (UV) absorbent. However, most of lignin resources are currently thrown away as a waste in the pulp and paper industries. For the value-added utilization of lignin, the incumbent study was aimed to exploit lignin as a reinforcing agent for the development of agar / lignin biocomposite film. The influence of lignin concentrations on the microstructure and functional groups of agar films were studied through SEM and FTIR spectroscopy, respectively. The effects of lignin concentrations on mechanical and optical properties, water vapor permeability, moisture content, water solubility, and thermal stability were also studied. "

The results showed that the lignin concentration significantly influenced the color of agar / lignin biocomposite films. The Hunter L-value (lightness) and total color difference (ΔE) values significantly decreased with the increasing lignin content. On the other hand, Hunter-a and b values of agar / lignin biocomposite films were higher than that of agar film.

The T660 values of agar and 10 wt% lignin incorporated films were 89.2±0.6% and 77.1±0.4% , respectively. This reduction in transparency values was mainly due to the addition of opaque lignin into the agar biopolymer. The differences in refractive index of the agar and lignin were also led to a decrease in transparency of the agar film [21]. Further, the light transmittance of agar film at 280 nm (T280) decreased significantly after incorporation of lignin and the degree of decrease was strongly dependent on the concentration of lignin. The transmittance values at 280 nm of agar and agar with 1 wt% lignin films was 51.9±0.6% and 4.7±0.4% , respectively, which was further decreased with a higher concentration of lignin. This drastic reduction in transmittance values might be due to the strong UV light absorbing tendency of lignin. This absorbance of UV light was due to chromophoric groups present in lignin [22]. The differences in transmittance of lignin films were not significant at visible region, but a dramatic decrease in transmittance in the UV region was observed, which will help the composite film to be used as a UV barrier packaging film.

The intense peak at 1070 and 930 cm^-1 are associated with the 3,6-anhydro-galactose bridges [27]. It can be observed that the peak intensities of agar film at 1643 and 1370 cm^-1 significantly decreased with increasing lignin content. This might be due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the agar carbonyl and sulfate groups with the hydroxyl groups of lignin. "

604,"Effect of lignin on water vapor barrier, mechanical, and structural properties of agar-lignin composite films.xml","['Results and discussions', 'Tensile properties']"," The values of tensile properties, such as tensile strength, elongation at break, and tensile modulus are presented in Table 2. The TS of the neat agar film was 45.5±2.7 MPa, which is lower than lignin incorporated composite film. The maximum tensile strength attributed to 3 wt% lignin incorporated film was 52.1±2.8 MPa. The increment in tensile strength could be due to the improved compatibility between lignin and agar biopolymer. The lignin is reported to have porous structures on its surfaces that might help in good compatibility with the agar. However, there was no significant increment in tensile strength with 5 and 10 wt% lignin films. The tensile strength of composite film mainly depends on dispersibility of filler in the polymer matrix [28]. At higher filler loading, lack of uniform dispersion and agglomeration of lignin lead to uneven stress transfer between lignin and agar matrix [29]. This could be clearly observed from the micrograph of agar / lignin films. It has been reported that the tensile strength of soy protein isolate increased from 14.5 MPa to 23.1 MPa with the addition of 6 wt% lignin, but a further increase of lignin content decreased the TS values [30]. Chen et al. [31] also reported that the tensile strength of chitosan film increased by the addition of lignin. Further, the EM of agar films increased with increasing lignin content, and the highest modulus was observed with 10 wt% lignin. The elongation at break values of the lignin reinforced biocomposites films were reduced at the lignin concentration at 5 wt% or higher. "

The results revealed that lignin content greatly affected the WVP values and it decreased with increasing lignin concentration. The maximum reduction in WVP values was occured at 10 wt% lignin films. It has been observed that WVP values of biopolymer films reduced by the addition of nano fillers such as clay [32]. They reported that the reduction of WVP caused the tortuous path for water vapor diffusion due to the impermeable clay layers distributed in the polymer matrix with increasing the effective diffusion path length. However, in the present case, we can expect the improved compatibility between lignin and agar. The reduction in WVP values of the composite films might be due to the strong intermolecular interaction between agar and lignin molecules that would lead to a good compatibility of these two components and increase the tortuous path for water vapor diffusion, which resulted in less permeation of water molecule through the polymer film.

Table 3 shows the contact angle of agar and agar / lignin biocomposite films. The contact angle of agar / lignin films was lower than agar film. This reduction in contact angle might be due to the roughness of the film after the addition of lignin. As seen in the SEM migrograph in Fig. 2, the lignin particles were more aggregated on the surface of the film at concentration at 5 wt% or above. Since, the alkaline lignin was used in the present study that is more hydrophilic in nature as compared to agar. Therefore, incorporation of lignin increased the hydrophilicity of the film resulted in decreased in water contact angle as compare the neat agar film. Rhim [11] prepared agar / nano clay composite films and reported that the incorporation of hydrophilic filler could decrease the water contact angle of agar-based nanocomposite films. "

The neat agar film (25.6±0.4% ) showed lower solubility than agar / lignin biocomposite films. With increasing lignin content the solubility increased, which might be due to the dissolution of lignin. The alkali lignin is dispersed well in water. Thus the solubility of agar / lignin composite films was higher than agar film. The results of the swelling ratio (SR) of the agar and biocomposite films are shown in Table 3. It seems that the reinforcement of lignin in agar significantly reduced the SR of the biocomposite films. This may be owing to the existence of a less interfacial area and less swelling nature of the lignin. Similar results were observed by Sahari et al. [33] who reported that the incorporation of natural fibers into the sugar palm starch film decreased the water uptake of the composite films. In addition, Demir et al. [34] reported that the formation of strong hydrogen or covalent bonding between the free hydroxyl groups of fibers and water molecules can reduce the uptake of more water. Furthermore, the lower interfacial adhesion could cause cracks and voids between the matrix and fiber. Therefore, the water molecules can easily penetrate and stored via the voids. "

This reduction in moisture content values might be attributed to the strong intermolecular force between agar and hydroxyl group of lignin. In other words, the reduction of moisture content might also be occurred by the aromatic polyphenolic rings present in lignin. "
611,"Effect of lignin on water vapor barrier, mechanical, and structural properties of agar-lignin composite films.xml","['Results and discussions', 'Thermogravimetric analysis']"," The effect of lignin content on thermal stability was studied by thermogravimetric analysis. The TGA and DTG graphs are presented in Fig. 4. The thermal degradation of pure lignin and agar / lignin biocomposite films showed three steps of degradation. The initial degradation of the samples occurred due the evaporation of moisture (up to 110 °C). In the second stage, the degradation temperature of the agar film reduced from 170 °C to 164 °C with the incorporation of 1 wt% lignin. The maximum degradation temperature of agar film also decreased with the incorporation of lignin. This behavior can be understood from lignin TGA / DTG curve. As can be seen from DTG of lignin, the decomposition starts from 150 °C. When lignin was incorporated into the agar, the degradation shifted to lower due to the slow decomposition of lignin than agar film. It is well known that lignin decomposes over a broad range of temperature from 150 °C to 600 °C. The thermal decomposition of lignin between 150 °C and 300 °C was due to the cleavage of α-and β-aryl-alkyl-ether linkages [35]. Thus, the onset and the maximum degradation temperature of agar / lignin films was lower than agar. The final degradation temperature of agar / lignin biocomposite films was similar to the neat agar film. In the end, the char content of agar, agar / lignin 1% , and agar / lignin 3% biocomposite films was 21, 17, and 20% , respectively (Table 4). As expected, the char residue of agar / lignin films was higher than agar due to the highest char content of lignin. In the case of 1 and 3 wt% lignin film, the lignin content was mild and lignin might decompose completely between 150 °C and 350 °C, whereas, char residue was higher with increasing lignin content due to the higher amount of lignin.

The tensile strength of agar / lignin films was higher compared to agar films. The surface morphology study revealed that the lignin dispersed uniformly into the agar biopolymer up to 5 wt% lignin content. The tensile strength and UV barrier properties were highest in agar films with 3 of lignin.

621,Effect of plasticizers and fatty acids on mechanical and permeability characteristics of chitosan films.xml,['Introduction']," There has been an increasing research interest in edible-biodegradable packaging films during the last decade, possibly due to their numerous advantages over non-biodegradable plastic packaging films. The application potential of edible films has been described in several reviews (Tharanathan, 2003; Park, Jun, & Marsh, 2001). Chitosan is a de-N-acetylated form of chitin, the second most abundant natural polymer obtained from the shells of crab, shrimp, etc. It consists mainly of beta (1-4)-2 amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose units. Chitosan, a natural, non-toxic, biodegradable polymer, available commercially, has been employed in a variety of applications (Tharanathan & Kittur, 2003). Chitosan can form transparent films, which may find application in a variety of packaging needs (Srinivasa, Revathy Baskaran, Ramesh, Harish Prashanth, & Tharanathan, 2002). Polymer blending is one of the effective methods for providing new materials for a variety of applications. Plasticizing agents are essential generally to overcome the brittleness of the biopolymeric films. Brittleness is an inherent quality attributed to the complex / branched primary structure and weak intermolecular forces of natural polymers. Plasticizers by reducing the intermolecular forces soften the rigidity of the film structure and increase the mobility of the biopolymeric chains, thus improving the mechanical properties. Glycerol is shown to improve film flexibility, reduce film puncture strength, elasticity and water vapor barrier properties of wheat gluten films (Gontard, Guilbert, & Cuq, 1993). Use of sorbitol exhibited best water vapor permeability (WVP) values (Parris, Coffin, Joubran, & Pessen, 1995). Arvanitoyannis, Psomiadou, and Nakayama (1996) revealed that films made out of sodium casienate and soluble starch contained sugar and glycerol as plasticizers. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been used in methylcellulose-based films (Turhan, Sahbaz, & Guner, 2001). As far as chitosan films and chitosan modified films are concerned, use of PEG (0.25% and 0.5% ) resulted in reduced tensile strength (TS) and WVTR of the film but percent elongation (% ε) increased (Wiles, Vergano, Barron, Bunn, & Testin, 2000). Butler, Vergano, Testin, Bunn, and Wiles (1996) reported modified chitosan films containing glycerol (0.25% and 0.5% ), to show decrease in TS, increase in% ε, but oxygen and ethylene permeability remained constant during the storage period. Blair, Guthrie, Law, and Turkington (1987) modified the chitosan film by blending with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and studied the TS and% ε and reported that chitosan sample with high amino group content and long chain length showed lower moisture regime than sample with low amino group and shorter chain length and the permeability of films decreased as the degree of deacetylation (DD) increased. So far, scanty reports are available on fatty acid blend chitosan films. An important role of an edible film is to reduce exchange of water between the product and environment. The barrier property of such films depend on both molecular diffusion co-efficient and solubility in water of the matrix (Mchugh, Aujard, & Krochta, 1994). The moisture sorption isotherm is a means to characterize the water absorption property of the film, which in turn is transmitted to the product inside. Knowledge of sorption isotherm is also important for predicting stability and quality changes during packaging and storage of food product. Chirife and Iglesias (1978) reviewed a number of isotherm equations for food and food products, but relatively only a few isotherms are reported for packaging film materials. Gennadios and Weller (1994) reported isotherm for corn zein, wheat gluten and mixed protein films and showed GAB isotherm model to have good description of their data. Chinnan and Park (1995) reported sorption isotherms for methyl-and hydroxypropyl cellulose films. The objective of this study was to produce chitosan blend films with three plasticizers and two fatty acids and to determine the mechanical and barrier properties and sorption characteristics. "

The chitosan-plasticizer blend solutions were stirred for 60 min prior to wet casting and drying. For fatty acid blend films, chitosan solution was heated to 60 °C and fatty acid was added with stirring, wet casted and dried under infrared (Tharanathan, Srinivasa, & Ramesh, 2002). "

The tests were carried out according to ASTM D-882 standard test (ASTM, 1995), with initial grip separation of 50 mm and cross head speed of 50 mm / min. TS was calculated by dividing the maximum load for breaking the film by cross-sectional area, and% ε by dividing film elongation at rupture to initial gauge length, and the values were measured both in longitudinal and transverse directions to observe whether any difference in the orientation of polymer chain occurs. Percent elongation is the ratio of extension to the length of the sample. The modulus of elasticity (ME) is the ratio of stress to strain at the linear portion of the curve. All means were compared with each other, the results of ANOVA indicated significance (p<0.05). The films were tested for impact strength (IS) as per ASTM methods. The normalized IS was calculated by dividing the impact energy by the average film thickness. "

Weight loss graphs were plotted with respect to time, and the linear least-square method was used to calculate water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) using the equation:WVTR=slope / filmarea. WVP was determined by using the equation (Chinnan & Park, 1995): WVP=(WVTR / P2-P1)L, where P1 is the partial pressure (kPa) inside the cup, P2 the water vapor partial pressure (kPa) at the film outer surface in the system and L the average film thickness (mm).

630,Effect of plasticizers and fatty acids on mechanical and permeability characteristics of chitosan films.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Mechanical properties']"," Chitosan blend films were optimized to 0.4% for glycerol, 0.5% for sorbitol, 0.6% for PEG and for fatty acids it was optimized to 0.5% . At higher concentration of plasticizers and fatty acids difficulty was experienced with miscibility in preparing the solution and easy peeling off the films. Shrinkage and breakage of the films were experienced while peeling off from the base material as well as during the study of their properties, at higher concentration. The mechanical properties of the chitosan-polyols and fatty acid blend films are shown in Table 2. The TS,% ε and ME could be used to describe how the mechanical properties are related to their chemical structure. TS indicates the maximum tensile stress that the film can sustain,% ε is the maximum change in length of a test specimen before breaking, and ME is a measure of the stiffness of the film. The results indicated that these properties vary with the nature of plasticizers used. The mechanical properties of the films were studied in both directions to know the orientation of molecule. The TS value of glycerol blend chitosan film showed decreasing trend in both the directions (Table 2). The film loses 50% of strength at 0.3% and 70% at 0.4% with the addition of glycerol (data not shown). Sorbitol blend films also showed a decreasing trend in TS, at optimized concentration its TS was 11.26 MPa. However PEG blend films behaved differently, initially their TS decreased but later increased. At optimized concentration the TS was found to be 38.15 MPa, which was comparable to that of native chitosan film. The TS and% ε are inversely correlated. The latter showed an increasing trend with the addition of plasticizers. Glycerol film showed maximum% ε values at 0.3% concentration and later decreased with further addition (data not shown). Sorbitol and PEG blend films showed maximum elongation at optimized levels. Glycerol was miscible easily with chitosan and became more flexible compared to other plasticizers. ME decreased with the addition of plasticizers. The glycerol and sorbitol blend films showed a drastic decrease in ME with small addition. In glycerol blend film with 0.1% addition the ME decreased by 50% , whereas with sorbitol and PEG, the decrease was 25% and 10% , respectively (data not shown). At optimized concentration the ME values were 19.35, 13.14 and 895 MPa, respectively for glycerol, sorbitol and PEG blend films. This shows PEG blend films to be much stiffer. This may partly be due to the introduction of glycerol or sorbitol moieties resulting in drastic chain flexibility, thereby the rigidity of native chitosan disappears, whereas with PEG, due to its higher molecular weight it forms a separate molecular layer over the chitosan film and retains stiffness. Also the smaller size of glycerol influences the mechanical property of the film, giving more elongation to the film compared to other plasticizers. Arvanitoyannis et al. (1996) reported that blending of gelatin with chitosan in addition to glycerol and sorbitol, gave films whose TS and ME were decreased to 130, 83 and 2050,1890 MPa, respectively. While Caner, Vergano, and Wiles (1998) reported a decrease from 32 to 17 MPa with the addition of PEG, while% ε increased to 42% . The TS and% ε values of methylcellulose film were decreased and increased with addition of different plasticizers (Donhowe & Fennema, 1993). The TS,% ε and ME of fatty acid blend films are shown in Table 2. The TS was 9.16 MPa for 0.1% of palmitic acid, with further addition (0.5% ) it increased to 16.22 MPa, while in stearic acid blend films it was 21.34 MPa. Shellhammer and Krochta (1997) reported decrease in TS of protein-lipid films. The% ε at break showed lower values (50% ). ME also showed a decreasing trend with the addition of fatty acids. IS measures the sudden load resisted by the packaging materials. No reports on IS of the biopolymer films compared to synthetic polymer films are available in the literature. Polyol blend films showed increase in IS (Table 2), with glycerol blend films showing the highest value (92 MPa). However, the fatty acid blend films showed a lower IS value compared to native film.

633,Effect of plasticizers and fatty acids on mechanical and permeability characteristics of chitosan films.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Barrier properties']"," WVP of native chitosan film was 0.01322 g m / m^2 day kPa. Incorporation of plasticizers affects the WVP of chitosan films (Table 2) to a considerable extent. WVP of chitosan-glycerol blend films decreased, at optimized concentration (0.4% ) the value was found to be 0.00784 g m / m^2 day kPa. This decrease could be due to the formation of hydrogen bonding in between the crevices of chitosan chains, thereby influencing water retardation. But addition of sorbitol did not show such a trend. Upon addition of 0.1% of sorbitol, WVP decreased to 0.009 g m / m^2 day kPa, (data not shown) but upon further addition (0.5% ) the WVP showed 0.0163 g m / m^2 day kPa, which is higher than that of native chitosan film. Addition of PEG showed a significant increase. At 0.2% the WVP was 0.019 g m / m^2 day kPa, whereas with further addition no significant differences were observed. This increase may be due to destabilization of chitosan matrix by long-chain PEG molecules thus widening the interstitial space in the chitosan matrix and thus allowing for an increased diffusion rate of water molecules through the films. Caner et al. (1998) reported that PEG addition to chitosan films increases WVP. Butler et al. (1996) reported a mean WVP ranging from 7.6×10^-2 to 1×10^-1 g / m day atm of glycerol blend films, as also reported earlier. Arvanitoyannis, Kolokuris, Nakayama, Yamamoto, and Aiba (1997) reported an increased WVP with the addition of glycerol, which is contrary to our result, where a decrease in WVP was observed. This may be due to the intrinsic chemical nature of chitosan and also to the way the blend films are prepared. McHugh et al. (1994) reported that addition of plasticizer also affects the WVP of whey protein films. No considerable difference in WVP were observed in fatty acid (stearic / palmitic acid) blend chitosan films (Table 2). The WVP varied from 0.01442 to 0.01352 g m / m^2 day kPa and no significant differences were observed between the two fatty acids blend films. This result is supported by the work of Wong, Gastineau, Gregorski, Tillin, and Pavlath (1992), where WVP and OTR properties of chitosan-lipid blend films were comparable. Plamitic acid film showed relatively a higher WVP compared to native films, probably due to the cationic nature of chitosan as well as the hydrophobicity of the blend films, wherein the water molecules may interact with matrix and increase the permeation rate (Pascat, 1986). Kamper and Fennema (1984) studied the WVTR of edible film blended with fatty acid, and reported that higher concentration of fatty acid will not affect the WVTR of blend films, but coating of fatty acid on edible film affects the WVTR. Interaction between packaging materials and food stuff can affect food quality. Gas permeability of food packaging materials is of great importance for food preservation (Arvanitoyannis, Nakayama, & Aiba, 1998). Barrier to moisture, oxygen, carbon dioxide, aroma and flavor compounds in a packaging system can increase food product shelf life and also improve the food quality (Park et al., 2001; Srinivasa et al., 2002). OTR of the plasticized and non-plasticized chitosan films, all dried under infrared, are shown in Table 2. Addition of glycerol and sorbitol into chitosan films increased, whereas addition of PEG decreased the OTR, comparatively sorbitol and glycerol blend films were observed to be better barrier to oxygen. This result is not surprising, since plasticization results in increased mobility of polymer chains and thus decreased resistance of films to gas transmission. The OTR values were decreased drastically with the addition of PEG, probably due to a significant increase in the crystalline spacing, which may facilitate diffusion through the expanded matrix with chitosan, in a manner that restricts the flow of O2. By nature, biopolymers offer potential barrier to gases. The OTR results showed that the addition of fatty acids decreases gas transmission rate, and no significant differences were observed between the two fatty acids. At 0.1% of stearic / palmitic acid there was a drastic reduction in OTR from 3.2 to 0.0639 cm^3 m / m^2 day kPa, (data not shown) but at optimized levels it was 0.0234 cm^3 m / m^2 day kPa, in accordance with the earlier report (Wong et al., 1992). The variation in permeability characteristics is ascribable to subtle microstructure of the films, viz. increase in density, pore formation, channeling and packing pattern of the lipids in the blend films. Transmission of gases through packed polymer is lowest when compared with that in water or air, with differences of three orders of magnitude (Mannapperuma & Singh, 1990). Earlier work of Arvanitoyannis et al. (1997) on CO2 sorption and permeability of PVA-chitosan blend films reported that permeability increases with addition of PVA. The low OTR in the blend film was attributed to the solute presumed to diffuse through the micro-channel or pore within the membrane structure. The water molecule thus fitted in the micro-channel may obstruct the movement of the gas molecule. Several factors may be responsible for differences in OTR of the plasticized films. These include the physical state of the plasticizer, molecular weight, altered film structure due to chemical interaction of plasticizer, and absorption of oxygen molecule. Any increase in the oxygen permeability that might have been anticipated because of glycerol fluidity and ability to expand chitosan matrix may have been off set by good oxygen barrier property of glycerol itself and by the ability of this small molecule to effectively fill in small voids in the polymer matrix.

634,Effect of plasticizers and fatty acids on mechanical and permeability characteristics of chitosan films.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Moisture sorption studies']"," The relationship between aw and moisture content (at constant temperature) is described by moisture isotherm. Moisture content of the film increases at elevated water activity (aw). The time to reach equilibrium moisture content (EMC) was about 25-30 days at lower humidity and 15-20 days at higher humidities. The sorption isotherm curves for EMC (db) obtained form different concentrations of chitosan-plasticizer blends are shown in Fig. 1a and b. At lower aw the slope of the curve was less; with increase in aw the slope increased rapidly. Considering the individual blend films, some mould growth was observed by visual inspection at edges and surfaces at the end of the storage period in native chitosan, and plasticizer blend films, but in fatty acid blend films, less number of colonies were observed, may be due to less moisture holding capacity of such films. Experimental data for moisture adsorption at 25 °C for polyols (Fig. 1a) and fatty acids (Fig. 1b) revealed sigmoid shape curves for all. The EMC of glycerol and sorbitol blend films showed logarithmic increase at above 0.6 aw and reached to highest moisture content of 45.2% and 43.6% at 0.9 aw, whereas PEG blend films did not show much increase in moisture content, at 0.4 aw, the uptake of moisture was more compared to other films, and this showed a linear increasing trend up to 0.7 aw, but later no exponential increase was observed. Fatty acid blend films showed a linear increase in moisture content as aw increased and showed lower moisture holding capacity compared to other blend films (15.45% ). No significant differences were observed between the two fatty acids. "

636,Effect of plasticizers and fatty acids on mechanical and permeability characteristics of chitosan films.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Moisture isotherm equations']"," Eight moisture isotherm mathematical models were fitted to the moisture sorption data of all blend films for the whole range of aw. The constants for respective model and RMSE values are tabulated in Table 3, Table 4, respectively for polyols and fatty acids blend films. The applicability of BET model is limited to a lower range of aw (0.1-0.4), whereas PEG blend films showed a goodness of fit above this range. The monolayer (Mm) and energy constant (C) of blend films varied from 6.85-9.81 and 11.50-45, respectively. PEG blend data suit very well in that range compared to those of other blend films. Palmitic acid blend films showed a better fit with RMSE value of 3.55 compared to stearic acid blend films (RMSE 5.78). Baldevraj, Eugeneraj, Kumar, and Siddarramaiah (2002) have studied the sorption characteristics of starch-LDPE and PVA blend films and determined the various constants. The GAB model is the most popular model in the area of food technology. Sorption data fits extremely well for many food materials over a wide range of aw (Bizot, 1984). But so far only limited studies have been carried out with blend films. GAB model is a choice for fatty acid blend chitosan films with RMSE values <3. In some plasticizer blend films the RMSE values were between 3 and 5 with an R^2 value of 0.99, M0 value in the range 8-15.76, G value in the range 14.60-25.6 and K value in the range 0.59-0.912. Chirife, Timmermann, Iglesias, and Boquet (1992) reported that the constant K in GAB sorption model varies from nearly unity to as low as 0.56 for large variety of food constituents and for proteins in the range of 0.82-0.88. Gennadios and Weller (1994) reported that GAB model was a better fit when applied over the aw range from 0.33 to 0.84 for protein films with high values of K. Lomauro, Baskshi, & Labuza (1985a), Lomauro, Baskshi, & Labuza (1985b) found that the GAB model gave a very good fit (p<5) for over 50% of 75 food isotherms for fruits and vegetables, and over 75% of 88 isotherms for coffee, tea, nuts, etc. Bradley model can be widely used for a wide range of aw (0.05-0.95) including sorption of water in proteins (Hoover & Mellon, 1950). The constants (K1 and K2) were determined by linear fitting of the equation where K2 is a function of sorptive polar groups and K1 is a function of the dipole moment of the sorbed vapor, and both these constants were found to be temperature dependent. K1 showed not much significant variation, it varied from 0.8 to 0.9, but K2 varied from 2.53 to 17.67 for all blend films. Baldevraj et al. (2002) reported that the Bradley sorption model fits very well in the aw range between 0.4 and 0.9. Walker, Wolf, and Kapsalin (1973) reported that for peanut protein films, Bradley model would fit for aw 0.3-0.9. In the present study, the Bradley sorption model was found to fit very well for the whole range of aw except for glycerol and sorbitol blend films, where the fit was possible between aw 0.4-0.9. Smith model has also been shown to fit water sorption isotherms of various biopolymers (Labuza, 1968). A good fit was documented for adsorption and desorption isotherms of Virgina-type peanuts above aw of 0.3 (Young, 1976). Pixton and Howe (1983) reported that the Smith model gave a satisfactory fit for water sorption curves of several food commodities including dried peas, dried figs, etc. The model showed a perfect fit for native chitosan film, compared to all other blend films with RMSE value of 3.92. Protein films showed goodness of fit in the range of 0.53-0.84 aw (Gennadios & Weller, 1994), whereas for above this range the data showed very poor fit, as also observed in the present study. The Oswin model was found very suitable to describe sorption isotherms of proteins and starchy foods (Boquet, Chirife, & Iglesias, 1978). Lomauro, Baskshi, & Labuza (1985a), Lomauro, Baskshi, & Labuza (1985b) concluded that this model fitted sorption data for a considerable number of nuts, spices, coffee, etc. In the present study the native chitosan film showed a perfect fit in the whole range of aw, with RMSE value of 3.72 with constants n and a of 0.38 and 13.03, respectively. For the plasticizer blend films these constants varied from 0.44 to 0.46 and 15.15 to 17.6 and RMSE of 6.14-10.89, respectively. The fatty acid blend films showed RMSE of 5.91 and 5.51, respectively, for stearic and palmitic acids. There was no considerable difference observed in the constants for the two fatty acids: n equals 0.31 and 0.32 and a equals 9.75 and 10.98 for stearic and palmitic acid blend films, respectively. Use of Halsey model is recommended for meats, milk products and vegetables (Boquet et al., 1978). According to Lomauro, Baskshi, & Labuza (1985a), Lomauro, Baskshi, & Labuza (1985b), this model was successfully applied for water sorption data of several nuts and oil seeds. Iglesias, Chirife, and Lombardi (1975) and Chirife and Iglesias (1978) found that Halsey's model is useful to describe reasonably well the sorption of dried figs, apricots and raisins and the total number of experimental isotherms to which they applied satisfactorily the Halsey's model amounted to 220. When this model was used to fit sorption data of chitosan blend films it showed a poor fit for aw 0.1-0.8. Nevertheless, this model gave excellent fit for sorbitol blend films (RMSE 4.04), whereas for all other films with RMSE values in the range 6.12-12.06, it showed a poor fit especially for PEG films with RMSE value of 27.12. Caurie model is purely a mathematical equation valid for aw 0.0-0.85. Native chitosan showed RMSE values of 5.11, whereas for all other blend films the values were in the range 3.03-3.58. The regression R^2 of native and blend films was 0.99. In plasticizer blend films only glycerol blend film showed a good fit (RMSE, 4.63), whereas all other blends with high RMSE values showed a poor fitness of the model. In fatty acid blend films stearic acid films showed high RMSE (10.63) compared to palmitic acid blend films (RMSE, 6.40). Harkins-Jura sorption isotherm model is restricted to regions in which the adsorbed molecules form a condensed film layer (Labuza, 1968). The equation usually does not hold good above aw of 0.6, as also seen in the present study, where the model is fit for aw in the range of 0.1-0.6. The model showed goodness of fit for sorbitol blend films (with low RMSE value 2.59). For all other films the RMSE values were above 5, and showed a poor fit of the model. "

639,Effect of plasticizers and fatty acids on mechanical and permeability characteristics of chitosan films.xml,['Conclusions']," In summary, the chitosan film prepared using different plasticizers showed several interesting characteristics. The tensile strength of the blend films decreased while elongation increased. Sorbitol films were more flexible compared to other plasticized films, whereas the PEG films were more tough. Addition of fatty acid did not influence the mechanical properties of the films. The water and gas barrier properties were also influenced by the blend films. This may be useful in the modified atmosphere packaging of fruits and vegetables. Overall, the sorption analysis of different models showed extremely good to very good fit as determined by RMSE and R^2 values. The constants derived from different sorption models were useful in the evaluation of the stability of chitosan-based packaging films. The applicability of water activity values will throw valuable information on the durability of packaging material for specific end uses. Also the constants derived from the respective models could be utilized to predict the EMC values, in comparison with the experimental values. "
640,Effects of modified cellulose nanocrystals on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,['abstract']," The aim of this paper is to report the impact of the addition of cellulose nanocrystals on the barrier properties and on the migration behaviour of poly(lactic acid), PLA, based nano-biocomposites prepared by the solvent casting method. Their microstructure, crystallinity, barrier and overall migration properties were investigated. Pristine (CNC) and surfactant-modified cellulose nanocrystals (s-CNC) were used, and the effect of the cellulose modification and content in the nano-biocomposites was investigated. The presence of surfactant on the nanocrystal surface favours the dispersion of CNC in the PLA matrix. Electron microscopy analysis shows the good dispersion of s-CNC in the nanoscale with well-defined single crystals indicating that the surfactant allowed a better interaction between the cellulose structures and the PLA matrix. Reductions of 34% in water permeability were obtained for the cast films containing 1 wt.% of s-CNC while good oxygen barrier properties were detected for nano-biocomposites with both 1 wt.% and 5 wt.% of modified and un-modified cellulose nanocrystals, underlining the improvement provided by cellulose on the PLA films. Moreover, the migration level of the studied nano-biocomposites was below the overall migration limits required by the current normative for food packaging materials in both non-polar and polar simulants.

646,Effects of modified cellulose nanocrystals on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,['Introduction']," Production of innovative “green materials” derived from natural sources is currently one of the main points of interest in the academic and industrial areas of material research. Studies based on nano-biocomposites using different reinforcements for poly(lactic acid), PLA, have been reported by many research groups in recent years (Fortunati et al., 2012a, Petersson et al., 2007, Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2008). PLA is a biodegradable thermoplastic polyester produced from l-and d-lactic acid, which is obtained from the fermentation of corn starch. PLA is currently commercialized and used in food packaging application for fresh or relatively short shelf-life products as containers, drinking cups, salad cups, overwrap and lamination films, and blister packages (Auras et al., 2006, Schwach et al., 2008). However, some drawbacks such as low thermal stability and poor barrier properties have reduced their application in food packaging. The addition of nanomaterials could be considered an adequate alternative to limit such problems and consequently to improve the possibilities for PLA based packages (Bordes et al., 2009, Martino et al., 2011). The use of cellulose nanowhiskers or nanocrystals has been proposed as the load-bearing constituent in developing new and inexpensive bio-materials due to their high aspect ratio, good mechanical properties and fully degradable and renewable character (Sturcova, Davies, & Eichhorn, 2005). If compared to other inorganic reinforcing fillers for biopolymers, cellulose nanocrystals have some additional advantages, including their wide availability of sources, low-energy consumption, ease of recycling including combustion, high sound attenuation and comparatively easy processability due to their non-abrasive nature, allowing high filling levels and significant cost savings (Samir & Dufresne, 2005). The use of cellulose nanocrystals as nano-reinforcements is an emerging field in nanotechnology, but there are still some obstacles for their use. Firstly, cellulose nanocrystals are not commercially available since their production is still associated with low yields. In addition, they are difficult to use with water insoluble polymers like PLA, because their high ability to produce strong hydrogen bonding. Therefore, cellulose nanocrystals have to be transferred from water to an appropriate solvent in order to produce and process PLA composite systems (Araki et al., 2001, Goussé et al., 2004, Heux et al., 2000). The control of the degradation rate and the release of potentially migrant compounds, are key issues for the design of biodegradable systems for food packaging. PLA is the most interesting biopolymer for manufacturing these materials, and consequently it should be prepared to be in contact with different types of food (Mutsuga, Kawamura, & Tanamoto, 2008). Lactic acid is the lone monomer in the PLA structure but migrants in PLA based systems could be lactic acid itself joined to dimmers and other oligomers, produced by the PLA hydrolysis (Jamshidian, Tehrany, Imran, Jacquot, & Desobry, 2010). However, different results could be found for PLA blends, composites and copolymers, with more complex migration processes. In general, food packaging materials should be designed to control the gas permeability and to minimize migration of additives and other compounds during storage or processing. The aim of this research is to study the impact of cellulose nanocrystals derived from highly purified cellulose fibres on the properties of PLA nano-biocomposites, with special focus on the barrier properties and on their interaction with food simulants.

After acid remotion, dialysis and ultrasonic treatment, the resultant cellulose nanocrystal aqueous suspension was approximately 0.5% by weight and the yield was ca. 20% . Furthermore, mixed bed ion exchange resin (Dowex Marathon MR-3 hydrogen and hydroxide form) was added to the cellulose suspension for 48 h and then removed by filtration. CNC suspension was neutralized by the addition of 1.0% (v / v) 0.25 mol L^-1 NaOH (Wang, Ding, & Cheng, 2007). The synthesized nanocrystals were then examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips Tecnai 10) operated at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV after the deposition of a droplet of dilute CNC suspension (0.1 wt.% ) on a bacitracin pre-treated surface of a carbon-coated grid. Modified cellulose nanocrystals (s-CNC) were obtained with an acid phosphate ester of ethoxylated nonylphenol (Beycostat A B09 (CECCA S.A.)) in a 1 / 4 (wt / wt) ratio (Heux et al., 2000). The pH of the suspension was then fixed to 8.5 by using the same 0.25 wt.% NaOH solution. After freeze drying, chloroform was directly added to the cellulose powder (both pristine CNC and s-CNC) forming 1 wt.% suspensions. In order to improve the cellulose dispersion in chloroform, the suspensions were exposed to sonication (Vibracell, 750) for 1 min in an ice bath. The morphological features of the modified nanocrystals after the dispersion in the organic solvent were investigated by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Supra 25-Zeiss). Few droplets of dilute s-CNC suspension (0.1 wt.% ) were deposited on a silicon wafer, gold sputtered and analysed.

For the preparation of the nano-biocomposite films, a predetermined amount of s-CNC suspension in chloroform was mixed with the previously prepared PLA solution. The solutions were stirred for 4 h before they were cast onto the glass Petri dish. The resultant films with a thickness of ca. 40 μm were peeled from the Petri dish after drying. Nano-biocomposites with 1 wt.% (PLA / 1s-CNC) or 5 wt.% (PLA / 5s-CNC) of s-CNC were prepared. For comparison, PLA / CNC films with 1 wt.% (PLA / 1CNC) and 5 wt.% (PLA / 5CNC) of un-modified CNC were produced by following the above-described procedure.

Samples in ethanol 10% were kept in a controlled chamber at 40 °C during 10 days, while samples in isooctane were kept at 20 °C during 2 days, according to EN-1186 standard. After the incubation period, the films were removed and simulants were evaporated to dryness. Furthermore, the residue was weighed with an analytical balance (Sartorius ATILON) with±0.1 mg precision in order to determine the overall migration value in mg kg^-1 of simulant. For each sample three determinations were performed and the final migration value was the average of the three determinations. In order to analyze the effect of incubation on the PLA nano-biocomposite properties, their surface microstructure, before and after incubation in ethanol 10% (v / v), was investigated by scanning electron microscope, FESEM, Supra 25-Zeiss.

654,Effects of modified cellulose nanocrystals on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Cellulose nanocrystals']"," The hydrolysis process allowed to obtain well individualized CNC with the typical dimensions ranging from 100 to 200 nm in length and 5-10 nm in width as previously reported (Fortunati et al., 2012a, Fortunati et al., 2012b). Nevertheless, the dispersion and self-ordering properties of cellulose nanocrystals are restricted to aqueous suspensions or dispersions in a few specific organic solvents with high dielectric constant such as DMSO or ethylene glycol (Turbak, Snyder, & Sandberg, 1983). The main reason for such restriction is the high tendency to agglomeration of these nanocrystals in non-polar solvents caused by their electrostatic character and the loss of stability of their suspensions. In consequence, their adequate dispersion in organic solvents is difficult. After the hydrolysis process, suspensions containing un-modified crystals (CNC) and surfactant modified cellulose (s-CNC), were freeze-dried and the cellulose powders were re-dispersed in chloroform. We have already reported the strategy to employ a surfactant to avoid aggregation and favour the dispersion of cellulose nanocrystals in chloroform (Fortunati, Armentano, Zhou, Puglia, et al., 2012). One example of a FESEM image of surfactant-modified cellulose nanocrystals dispersed in chloroform is reported in Fig. 1a. Results obtained for crystal shape and size highlighted that no particular morphological modifications occurred during the dispersion in the organic solvent and CNC maintained their original acicular structure. Moreover, the flow birefringence properties of cellulose nanocrystal suspensions in CHCl3 were investigated (Fig. 1b). Suspensions exhibited strong shear birefringence, highlighting the ability of nanocrystals to form a chiral nematic liquid crystalline phase in equilibrium with the isotropic phase (Fleming, Gray, & Matthews, 2001). The flow birefringence of modified nanocrystals in chloroform proved their good dispersion in chloroform suggesting that the suspension contained a large number of single cellulose crystals, highlighting the success of the proposed modification process.

656,Effects of modified cellulose nanocrystals on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'PLA nano-biocomposite morphology and crystalline structure']"," Nano-biocomposite morphological behaviour was analysed by TEM and the main results are reported in Fig. 2. For the binary PLA / 1CNC and PLA / 5CNC nanocomposites (Fig. 2a and c, respectively) it was observed that most of the crystals were flake like structure consisting of tightly packed cellulose structures. This cluster formation may indicate that pristine cellulose nanocrystals tend to agglomerate by hydrogen bonding and the nano-biocomposite processing used in this work is not strong enough to avoid this process. A different behaviour was detected for PLA / 1s-CNC and PLA / 5s-CNC (Fig. 2b and d, respectively). TEM analysis of these systems showed the good dispersion of s-CNC in the nanoscale, since well-defined single crystals were detected in the cross-section of both nanocomposites. Therefore it is concluded that the surfactant was able to cover the single crystals during the solvent casting process allowing a better dispersion of cellulose structures in the PLA matrix. The structures of pure PLA polymer, cellulose nanocrystal powder, and PLA nano-biocomposites were characterized by wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) in order to study the effect of the nanocrystals type and content on the crystallinity of the PLA matrix. Fig. 3a shows WAXS curves for PLA and CNC. PLA only showed a wide diffraction band at 2θ = 16.5 °, giving the idea of the PLA amorphous nature. On the other hand, cellulose nanocrystals exhibited four main reflection peaks at 2θ = 15.0 °, 16.3 °, 22.5 ° and 34.4 ° (this last less defined) relative to the cellulose I crystalline structure. Fig. 3b shows the effect of cellulose nanocrystals content and modification on nano-biocomposites crystallinity. The peaks at 2θ = 16.5 ° and 22.4 ° were the most prominent, being indicative of the PLA and cellulose crystallinities, respectively. The WAXS curves for nanocrystals peaks at 2θ = 15.0 ° and 16.3 °, were not identified at these low cellulose contents, being replaced by a broad shoulder at around 2θ = 16 °, typical of a predominant amorphous material. However, when the nanocrystals content increased to 5 wt.% , a steady increase in the intensity of the peaks at 2θ = 22.5 ° was observed in both, CNC and s-CNC based systems, suggesting again an increase in the overall crystallinity of the nano-biocomposites. The narrow peak at 2θ = 16.5 ° for the PLA / 5CNC system and the presence of a shoulder at around 2θ = 19 ° for the PLA / 5CNC and PLA / 5s-CNC nano-biocomposites were indicative of the increased ability to crystallize of the modified-nanocrystal based systems (Hossain et al., 2012).

659,Effects of modified cellulose nanocrystals on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'PLA nano-biocomposite permeability studies']"," Table 1 gathers the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) values and the water vapour permeability (WVP) coefficients of PLA and PLA nano-biocomposites reinforced with both unmodified CNC and surfactant modified s-CNC. Reductions in OTR values with respect to the PLA film of ca. 9% in the case of un-modified CNC added at 1 wt.% , and of ca. 26% in s-CNC based systems, at the same percentage were detected. These results underlined the positive effect of the cellulose modification in the increase in barrier properties. This effect was confirmed for the PLA / 5s-CNC films that showed the highest reduction in OTR values (ca. 48% ). Moreover, a positive influence of cellulose content was revealed since the nano-biocomposites with 5 wt.% of cellulose also showed the best oxygen barrier properties for un-modified CNC based systems (reduction of ca. 43% ). It is well known that the transport properties of gases through polymer films are strongly influenced by the tortuousity of their path, which is dependent on several factors including shape and aspect ratio of the filler, degree of exfoliation or dispersion, filler loading and orientation, adhesion to the matrix, moisture activity, filler-induced crystallinity, polymer chain inmobilization, filler-induced solvent retention and porosity (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2008). Martino, Ruseckaite, Jiménez, and Averous (2010) also observed the improvement of PLA barrier properties due to a geometric factor which increased the tortuousity for gas molecules pathway to go through the film thickness as a consequence of the nanofiller addition. In our case, the s-CNC based nanocomposites are dispersed to a higher extent as showed in TEM analysis and possesses higher levels of crystallinity as show by the previous WAXS analysis, thus yielding a more efficient barrier effect (Fortunati, Armentano, Zhou, Puglia, et al., 2012). Water vapour permeability coefficients are also reported in Table 1. These data are similar to others already reported (Sanchez-Garcia & Lagaron, 2010). Reductions of water permeability of ca. 34% were obtained for the cast films containing 1 wt.% of modified nanocrystals while a lower effect in the barrier properties for the PLA / 1CNC nano-biocomposite was detected. The positive effect of cellulose modification in WVP barrier properties was also evident for this formulation. Lower reductions in water vapour permeability were detected in the case of nano-biocomposites reinforced with 5 wt.% of pristine CNC and modified s-CNC (4% and 15% , respectively, with respect to the value measured for PLA film). This particular result was already reported by Sanchez-Garcia et al. (2008). They indicated that the barrier properties to water of PLA nano-biocomposites containing cellulose microfibres were only reduced (by ca. 10% ) in the sample containing 1 wt.% of the filler. Samples with 4 or 5 wt.% microfibres content showed no barrier improvements. It has been indicated that nano-biocomposites containing between 2 and 3 wt.% of nanocrystals exhibited the highest water and oxygen barrier. However, in this case, good oxygen barrier properties were also detected for nano-biocomposites with 5 wt.% of cellulose nanocrystals underlining the success of the solvent casting procedure and the reinforcement effect of both, pristine and modified nanocelluloses. Thereafter the barrier properties were significantly enhanced with the addition of modified cellulose compared to those nano-biocomposites with pristine cellulose at the same filler content. These results are in good agreement with previous studies concerning the crystallization kinetics of PLA-nanocellulose composites influenced by the filler nucleation effect (Fortunati, Armentano, Zhou, Puglia, et al., 2012).

661,Effects of modified cellulose nanocrystals on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'PLA nano-biocomposite overall migration']"," Overall migration tests with simulants were carried out to determine the total amount of non-volatile substances that might migrate into foodstuff from PLA films (Schmidt et al., 2011). The results of overall migration levels of PLA and PLA nano-biocomposites, in ethanol 10% (v / v) and isooctane are shown in Fig. 4. After 2 days of incubation at 20 °C, the maximum migration level in isooctane was 0.16 mg kg^-1 of simulant for PLA / 5CNC. This value is much lower than the migration limits for food contact materials, 60 mg kg^-1 of simulant, established by the current legislation (Commission Directive, 2002 / 72 / EC). By comparison of the total migration values for all samples in isooctane, there is a clear effect of the presence of cellulose nanocrystals that promote significantly the migration of the simulant. Neat PLA and PLA nano-biocomposites with 1 wt.% of cellulose showed negligible migration values. Samples with s-CNC had lower migration levels than those with CNC and this could be due to a better adhesion or interaction of the nanocrystals to the polymer matrix, as previously discussed. In the case of migration in ethanol 10% (v / v), in general, higher migration levels were observed in comparison with isooctane, but all values were well below the overall migration legislative limits. Similar migration levels were observed for neat PLA and for the nano-biocomposites. Thermodynamic properties, such as polarity and solubility, play an important role on migration due to interactions between the polymer, migrants and the food simulant (FS). If the migrant has a poor solubility in the FS it will be retained in the polymer matrix, while a simultaneous effect based on the high affinity between FS and the polymer could be also present leading to the absorption by the polymer matrix. In addition, sorption of certain organic solvents could cause swelling of the polymer matrix, thereby enlarging the gaps between the molecules and enhancing the additive migration (Zygoura, Paleologos, & Kontominas, 2011). In the case of this study, migration in isooctane was observed since the solvent might be absorbed in the polymer matrix, leading to the release of the small particles like nanocrystals and PLA degradation products.

663,Effects of modified cellulose nanocrystals on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Effect of ethanol interaction on PLA and PLA nano-biocomposites']"," The visual observation of PLA and PLA nano-biocomposite films immersed in ethanol 10% (v / v) for 10 days at 40 °C, revealed that the gross appearance of all these films changed after the overall migration test. The PLA nano-biocomposites were initially almost transparent. As the incubation time proceeded, samples lost their transparency and became whitish due to the water absorption (data not shown). The observed whitening during the incubation of the PLA nano-biocomposite films is assumed to be an effect of the molecular rearrangement caused by the increased mobility induced by the FS and it has been previously reported to be the result of accelerated spherulite formation (Sodergård & Stolt, 2002). For this reason, the surface microstructure and the thermal behaviour of PLA and PLA nano-biocomposite films, after the incubation in ethanol 10% (v / v), were investigated. Fig. 5 shows the FESEM images of the binary PLA nano-biocomposites compared with the neat PLA film, before and after the overall migration test. After 10 days at 40 °C, a surface erosion with the appearance of holes on the PLA and PLA nano-biocomposites was detected since polylactide is a polyester resin, that are weak to alcohol (Mutsuga et al., 2008). Moreover, Fig. 5 highlights that holes about 10 μm in diameter were present on s-CNC nano-biocomposite surface, in particular in the PLA / 5s-CNC system, while smaller holes were observed on neat PLA and PLA nano-biocomposites with un-modified CNC. A clear surface erosion with some fractures characterized the PLA / 5CNC sample after the migration test. This behaviour could be the result of a higher ability of the system to interact with the polar solvent and it is in agreement with the low reductions detected in the WVP test. The thermal behaviour of PLA nano-biocomposites after 10 days of incubation in ethanol 10% (v / v) was studied by DSC. The main thermal parameters are summarized in Table 2. The heating thermogram of the pristine PLA film showed the glass transition temperature (Tg) at about 45 °C, followed by the melting endotherm signal with its maximum (Tm) at about 151 °C. A similar behaviour was detected for all pristine PLA nano-biocomposites (Table 2). The cold crystallization peak was not clearly visible since although semi-crystalline, the PLA 3051D was reported to have slow nucleation and crystallization rates (Fortunati et al., 2011, Wu et al., 2007). A different thermal behaviour was detected for the material after incubation. The heating thermograms displayed the glass-transition temperature, a well visible cold crystallization peak and the melting endothermal peak (data not shown). After 10 days of incubation the Tg increased for all the studied systems as the result of the annealing with the enthalpy relaxation peak and the cold crystallization became clearly visible in the first heating scan for all samples. The crystalline domains originated during the degradation process could act as cross-linking agents, hindering the motion of the polymer chains and consequently increasing the Tg value (De Paula, Mano, & Vargas Pereira, 2011). At low temperature additional endothermic shoulder upon melting (T'm) characterized the PLA sample and PLA nano-biocomposites based on unmodified CNC (Table 2). The presence of multiple melting peaks in PLA is well known and has been related to the formation of different crystal structures (Yasuniwa, Sakamo, Ono, & Kawahara, 2008) or to lamellar populations with different perfection degrees (Kong & Hay, 2003) induced by the incubation conditions (Fortunati et al., 2011). Poly(lactic acid) can exhibit up to three possible crystal modifications (α, β and γ), depending upon the crystallization conditions. The crystal structure of α and β forms has been widely investigated (De Santis and Kovacs, 1968, Eling et al., 1982, Hoogsteen et al., 1990) highlighting that the β-structure melts at temperature about 10 °C below the melting temperature of the α-structure. From this observation they concluded that the PLA β-structure is some-what less stable than the α-structure. The phenomenon of multiple melting peaks was not detected in the case of s-CNC based systems where only one melting peak at around 151 °C was detected highlighting a higher thermal stability respect to neat PLA and PLA based CNC films. Moreover, when the surfactant modified cellulose (s-CNC) was added to PLA, the cold crystallization temperature decreased by approximately 17 °C. The interaction of PLA with the simulant, promotes a different arrangement of PLA molecular chains that influences the thermal behaviour of these systems. The crystals forms of PLA are related to the crystallization temperature (Tc). Zhang, Tashiro, Tsuji, and Domb (2008) described that a crystal form named α' form (a disordered form of α-PLA) is observed when polymer is crystallized at temperatures below 120 °C. These authors described that at Tc < 100 °C there is only one crystal form, i.e. α'. When the temperature increases, the α crystals start to appear and the amount of α' crystals decreases, this is at temperatures 100 °C < Tc < 120 °C PLA crystallized in a combination of α and α' phases. The ability to reorganize the PLA structures is due to the chain flexibility, which is the result of the swelling of the amorphous phase and it is also due to the simulant diffusion through the polymer. In our case, the ability to re-crystallize during the first heating scan changed after the incubation in ethanol and the effect was also conditioned by the cellulose type. The nucleation effect is more significant in s-CNC based systems, highlighting the influence of the modification on the final properties of the system. In Fig. 6 the WAXS patterns of samples after incubation in ethanol 10% (v / v) for 10 days at 40 °C are observed confirming a dramatic change with respect to the pristine materials. Two peaks appear at 30.5 and 41.2 ° in all samples that can be attributed to a change in the crystallization form of PLA during incubation. This is in agreement with DSC results where the crystallinity of the samples changed after migration with the appearance of new crystals forms α and α' but no increase of the overall crystallinity content was observed. In addition, samples with nanocellulose showed a sharpening of the peak at 16.6 °, indicating that PLA suffered some structural rearrangement due to the presence of cellulose. The area of this peak was negligible in comparison with the amorphous halo, and consequently no increase in crystallinity was observed after migration tests (Ublekov, Baldrian, Kratochvil, Steinhart, & Nedkov, 2012). Thermogravimetric analysis was also performed before and after the incubation with ethanol 10% (v / v) in order to investigate the degradation behaviour of these materials. The maximum degradation temperatures (Tmax) of PLA and nano-biocomposites before and after the test are shown in Table 2. A complete weight loss with a single step was detected for neat PLA and all the studied composites before and after the incubation and no evident changes were detected in Tmax value. This aspect highlights that at this step, the simulant penetration is able to induce modification in the polymer chain arrangement as previous discussed without affecting their pyrolysis temperature.

667,Effects of modified cellulose nanocrystals on the barrier and migration properties of PLA nano-biocomposites.xml,['Conclusions']," PLA nano-biocomposites reinforced with un-modified and surfactant modified cellulose nanocrystals were successfully prepared by solvent casting and the effect of cellulose modification and amount in the composite was deeply investigated. TEM analysis showed the good dispersion of s-CNC in the nanoscale indicating that the addition of surfactant allowed the better dispersion of the CNC in the PLA matrix. The effect of cellulose nanocrystals in the PLA matrix was also investigated in term of barrier properties (oxygen transmission rate-OTR and water vapour permeability-WVP) and overall migration test in consideration of the intended application in food packaging. Reductions of 34% in WVP were obtained for films with 1 wt.% of s-CNC and good oxygen barrier properties were obtained for all nano-biocomposites, underlining the success of the solvent casting procedure and the reinforcement effect of cellulose. Moreover, the migration level of the studied nano-biocomposites were below the overall migration limits indicated in the current legislation in both non-polar and polar simulants, suggesting the possibility to use these systems in food packaging applications. Finally, the effects of ethanol (10% , v / v) on PLA and PLA nano-biocomposites after the overall migration tests were investigated. DSC and WAXS analyses underlined that the ability to re-crystallize of studied nano-biocomposites changed after the test and that the nucleation effect was most marked in s-CNC systems highlighting the influence of the modification on their final properties.

668,Enhancement of the gas separation properties of polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane by incorporation of silica nano particles.xml,['abstract']," In the present work, the effect of silica nano particles on the permeability of CO2, CH4 and N2 gases in polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes has been studied. Silica particles were prepared via the sol-gel method through the hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). PBI and PBI-silica hybrid membranes were prepared by thermal phase inversion method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction and FTIR analyses were employed in order to characterize the PBI and PBI-silica composite membranes. The obtained SEM micrographs confirmed the nano-scale distribution of silica particles in the polymer matrix. Gas permeation experiments showed an increase in the solubility and a corresponding reduction in the diffusivity of the gases through the membranes by increasing the silica content in the polymer matrix; consequently, the permeability of the condensable CO2 and CH4 gases were enhanced whereas that of non-condensable N2 gas significantly decreased upon increasing the silica content of the nano-composite membranes. The permeability of CO2 and its selectivity over N2 was increased from 0.025 Barrer and 3.5 in pure PBI to 0.11 Barrer and 71.3 in the nano-composite containing 20 wt% of the silica particles. There was a strong correlation between the solubility coefficients and condensability of the gases, as well as the diffusion coefficient of the penetrants and their kinetic diameter. Higuchi model fitted fairly well with the experimental results concerning the permeability of nitrogen gas in nanocomposite membranes, supposing the KH = 3.8. "

674,Enhancement of the gas separation properties of polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane by incorporation of silica nano particles.xml,['Introduction']," Increasing the efficiency of polymeric membranes for instance through the development of modern membranes with enhanced permeability and selectivity is one of the most predominant concerns of the researchers specialized in the field of membranes science and technology [1], [2], [3]. One of the most interesting applications of the polymer membranes is the separation of CO2 gas which is of significant importance in natural gas sweetening [4], [5], in the food packaging industries [6] and industrial waste gas streams in view of global warming prevention [7]. One of the most important and practical methods for improving the performance of polymer membranes used in the gas separation especially in the CO2 separation in gas streams is the incorporation of inorganic materials like silica particles into the polymer membrane [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. The presence of silica particles in the polymer matrix with a desirable distribution leads to the enhancement of the mechanical strengths as well as thermal stability of the polymer. Controlling the morphology and the phase separation phenomenon is a key factor to achieve a homogeneous structure in the composite membranes. The required homogeneity is most often provided by the physical connectivity between the organic and inorganic phases for instance through the employment of some compatibilizers. The addition of silica particles into the polymer matrix may bring about some possible effects on the polymer-silica composite as follows:•The presence of silica particles can serve to induce an increase in the mean distance between polymer chains. The alterations made to the polymer structure by limiting the chain packing, leads to an increased permeability and also may result in the enhancement of permselectivity (the ratio of permeablities of pure gases) provided that it causes an increase in the polymer structure stiffness due to the restricted segmental motion which in comparison with the solubility factor, plays a more important role in the modification of the performance of the polymer [8], [9], [10].•The interactions between the extra OH groups of the inorganic materials and gases containing polar bonds such as CO2 and SO2, as well as the consequent morphological changes, results in the enhancement of solubility due to the increase of the Henry's law coefficient [11].•The weak interaction between the silica and polymer leads to the formation of some voids at the interface of the two phases (polymer and silica) which in turn results in a major boost to the gas permeability [26]. By controlling the interaction between the silica and polymer, the amount of the voids at the interface can be controlled as well.•The presence of silica particles brings about some sort of physical barriers in the polymer membrane which changes the gas permeation pathway to an indirect path, hence resulting in decreased polymer permeability [16]. The presence of silica particles can serve to induce an increase in the mean distance between polymer chains. The alterations made to the polymer structure by limiting the chain packing, leads to an increased permeability and also may result in the enhancement of permselectivity (the ratio of permeablities of pure gases) provided that it causes an increase in the polymer structure stiffness due to the restricted segmental motion which in comparison with the solubility factor, plays a more important role in the modification of the performance of the polymer [8], [9], [10]. The interactions between the extra OH groups of the inorganic materials and gases containing polar bonds such as CO2 and SO2, as well as the consequent morphological changes, results in the enhancement of solubility due to the increase of the Henry's law coefficient [11]. The weak interaction between the silica and polymer leads to the formation of some voids at the interface of the two phases (polymer and silica) which in turn results in a major boost to the gas permeability [26]. By controlling the interaction between the silica and polymer, the amount of the voids at the interface can be controlled as well. The presence of silica particles brings about some sort of physical barriers in the polymer membrane which changes the gas permeation pathway to an indirect path, hence resulting in decreased polymer permeability [16]. Kusakabe et al. studied the effect of silica particles on a polyimide type polymer [10]. They showed that the incorporation of silica in the polymer matrix results in a 10 times increase in the permeability of CO2. Joly et al. investigated the effect of silica on another type of polyimide [11]. They observed 1.5-2 times increase in the gas sorption and 50% increase in the gas permeability as a result of incorporating silica particles in polyimide membranes. Observation of the morphological changes in the polyimide-silica composite membrane confirmed a significant reduction in the polymer chain packing density at the interface between the two phases that causes an increase in the Henry's law coefficient and the Langmuir sorption constants in the composite membrane [11]. Moaddeb and Koros studied the gas transportation properties of thin polyimide membranes in the presence of silica particles [9]. The presence of silica improved the gas separation properties of the polyimide, particularly for O2 and N2. Cornelius et al. studied the effects of alkoxysilanes on the morphology and gas permeation properties in a group of polyimide-silica nanocomposite membranes [17], [18], [19], [20]. After annealing, an increase of about 200-500% in the gas permeation of the nanocomposite membranes was detected, while the permselectivity dropped slightly. The authors attributed the increase in gas permeation to the changes in the free volume distribution which leads to the enhanced local segmental mobility of the chain ends. Suzuki and Yamada [21] reported the physical and gas transport properties of a 6FDA-based hyperbranched polyimide-silica nanocomposite membrane. The gas permeability coefficients of the membrane increased as the silica content increased. It was pointed out that the increased gas permeabilities were mainly attributable to the increase in the gas solubilities. Pinnau and He [22], [23] and Merkel et al. [24], [25] suggested that the addition and increasing the amount of nano-sized impermeable particles of commercial fumed silica to poly(4-methyl-2-pentyne) (PMP) increases the gas and vapor permeabilities. Pinnau et al. also investigated the effect of silica particles on polysulfone membranes [26]. They observed that the addition of silica significantly enhances the gas permeability of polysulfone with increasing silica content. They concluded that such a behavior results from an increase in the free volumes because of the inefficient chain packing as well as the presence of extra void volume at the interface between polymer and silica [24], [25], [26]. Kim et al. investigated the effect of the incorporation of silica particles in poly(amide-6-b-ethylene oxide) (PEBAX) [16]. By the study of the filled membrane, they realized that the presence of silica has a significant influence on the membrane morphology hence, the gas permeability and solubility increase 2-3 times in composite membranes. Kim et al. suggested that the crystalline phase of the PA is considerably reduced upon the incorporation of silica domains into the polymer matrix [16]. In our previous study we have investigated the effect of silica nano particles on the gas separation properties of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) [41]. The presence of silica particles was proved to increase the gas permeation of the nanocomposite membranes by a significant amount of about 200% , as well as a 60-80% increase in the permselectivity. Polybenzimidazole, represents excellent thermal, mechanical and chemical stabilities which makes it potentially a suitable choice for the gas separation purposes. However, due to the relatively high chain packing density, it exhibits some shortcomings in the gas separation applications [27], [28], [29]. Recently, a study has been conducted in order to improve the gas separation properties of this polymer type via systematic structure architecture in polybenzimidazole. Kumbharkar et al. [29], suggested that the incorporation of hexafluoroisopropylidene and butyl groups led to amorphous polymers with slightly lowered thermal stability and decreased chain packing. PBI based on 4,4-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) and 5-butyl isophthalic acid exhibited 10-40 times higher permeability, while changes in selectivities for industrially important gas pairs except O2 / N2 ranged from decrease of 75% or less than that of PBI based on isophthalic acid. The O2 / N2 selectivity was almost doubled in case of PBI based on 5-butyl isophthalic acid [29]. In the present work, we have tried to enhance the gas separation properties of polybenzimidazole membranes via incorporation of silica nano particles in membrane. The silica particles were prepared by the hydrolysis of TEOS using GOTMS compatibilizer through the sol-gel method. The permeabilities of methane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases were measured under 20 bar pressure and at a temperature of 25 °C. Eventually, the influence of the particles on the structure and separation properties of the gas was explored. "
675,Enhancement of the gas separation properties of polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane by incorporation of silica nano particles.xml,['Theory']," Proposing the models to predict the gas permeability of composite membranes is one of the research aspects in mixed matrix membrane area. There are different equations to predict gas permeability behavior of composite membranes based on the permeability of composing phases in the mixed matrix membranes. Maxwell [30], using the potential theory for electrical conduction through a heterogeneous media, obtained the exact solution for the conductivity of random distributed and non-interacting homogeneous solid spheres in a continuous matrix. Maxwell equation applied to the effective permeability of a dispersion of spheres in a continuous phase with the permeabilities of Pd and Pc, respectively, is as follows [30]:(1a)Peff=PcPd+2Pc-2ϕ(Pc-Pd)Pd+2Pc+ϕ(Pc-Pd)=Pc2(1-ϕ)+α(1+2ϕ)(2+ϕ)+α(1-ϕ)where(2)α=pdPcwhere Pc and Pd are the permeabilities of a given penetrant in the continuous and disperse phases, respectively. It is useful to define the “reduced permeation polarizability”, β, as(3)β=α-1α+2=Pd-PcPd+2Pcβ is a convenient measure of penetrant permeability difference between the two phases; it is bounded by-0.5 ≤ β ≤ 1, where the lower and upper limits correspond to totally nonpermeable and to perfectly permeable filler particle (disperse phase), while, β = 0, implies α = 1 (equal permeability in both phases). Eq. (1a), as a function of β is then reduced to:(1b)Peff=Pc1+2βϕ1-βϕ Other expressions have been proposed to predict composite membrane permeability. The analogue dielectric model has been extensively studied [31]. The more important models developed for two-phase mixed matrix membranes are those of Bruggeman [32], Higuchi [33], Maxwell-Wagner-Sillar [34] and the simple power law (percolation theory model) [35]. The formulas of Higuchi [33], considered to be applicable to random dispersions of spherical particles, is(4)PeffPc=1+3ϕβ1-ϕβ-KH(1-ϕ)β2 Parameter KH in Eq. (4) is treated as an empirical constant assigned a value of 0.78 on the basis of experimental data. Just like the Maxwell model, the Higuchi model was originally suggested to predict dielectric constant of two-phase mixtures. Higuchi suggested that some factors like particle size distribution for a system of spheres would influence the effective dielectric constant. He also suggested that other phenomena such as preferential agglomeration, sedimentation and surface effects may also affect the KH value [33]. "

TEOS was hydrolyzed under continuous agitation at 80 °C for 1 h leading to the formation of a clear and transparent silica-sol. The density of silica was measured to be 2.2 g / cm^3. PBI-silica nanocomposite membranes were prepared by the same method following the addition of the silica-sol in different weight fractions to the polymer solution. The volume fraction (Φf) of silica in hybrid membranes was calculated by the following equation:(5)Φf=wf / ρf(wp / ρp)+(wf / ρf)where wf and wp refer to the weight of filler and polymer, and ρf and ρp are the density of filler and polymer, respectively. Table 1 shows the amount of silica which is incorporated in hybrid PBI-silica membranes in terms of volume and weight fraction of silica in polymer. "

683,Enhancement of the gas separation properties of polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane by incorporation of silica nano particles.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Characterization of membranes']"," Structural characterization of pure silica, PBI and hybrids were carried out using the FTIR analysis. The results are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. The most intensive peak at 1077 cm^-1 representing SiOSi asymmetric stretching and SiOSi Rocking stretch peak at 453 cm^-1 in pure silica are observed in the spectra of hybrids. In addition, the SiOSi symmetric stretching (vibrational mode of ring stretching) at 800 cm^-1 suggested that the sol-gel reaction was successfully carried out. The broad peak at around 3500 cm^-1 in silica indicated that there was a significant amount of OH groups. These non-condensed OH groups provide the connection (hydrogen bonding) between PBI and partially hydrated silica particles, resulting in the homogeneous films. For more investigation of the effect of silica nano particles on PBI, the NH stretching regions of PBI-silica hybrids are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in this figure the pure PBI shows a broad intensive peak in the range of 3400 to 3066 cm^-1 and a weak peak at 3640 cm^-1. By increasing, the silica particles in hybrid membranes the intensity of the peak that appeared at 3640 cm^-1 decreased significantly and also the peak that appeared for NH stretching broadened in the wider range from 3400 to 2920 cm^-1. These phenomena indicate the hydrogen bonding between NH groups in PBI repeat unit and OH groups existed in silica particles, which lead to broadening of NH absorbance peak to lower frequencies. This observation indicates a good distribution and dispersion of silica particles in the polymer matrix [16]. It should be noted that overlaps of small peak at 3640 cm^-1 and OH groups in silica particles may affect the reduction of the intensity of this peak. The morphological changes caused by the presence of silica nano particles in the polymer matrix were investigated using wide angle X ray diffraction (WAXD). Fig. 4 illustrates the XRD pattern of pure PBI in comparison with PBI-silica composite samples. As can be observed in this figure, a broad peak can be identified at 2θ = 22.5 in the pure sample. The presence of silica particles has not a significant influence on the crystalline structure of the polymer except for a mild reduction in the intensity of the broad peak, as confirmed by the X ray patterns. So it can be concluded that from the morphological point of view, the prepared membranes are all amorphous and no crystallinity is formed in the pure polymer and the PBI-silica composite membrane. The morphology of the prepared pure and composite membranes was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As can be seen in Fig. 5, the prepared membranes are dense and symmetric. A 50,000-100,000 magnification of the composite membranes micrographs, demonstrates a nano-scale distribution of silica particles in the polymer matrix. This confirms the desirable mixing of the silica in polymer and also a good compatibility between the two phases. For more consideration the distribution of silica nano particles have been evaluated by mapping the particles in the cross section of the membranes. As shown in Fig. 6 the silica particles are distributed homogenously in all of the membrane cross section. The SEM-EDX analysis also has been done to show the presence of silica particles in the membrane (Fig. 7). "

The diffusivity of the gases was measured according to the time lag method using Eq. (8). The solubility (S) of the gases for each sample was then calculated according to Eq. (9) using the permeability and diffusivity values of the gases. Table 2, summarizes the diffusivity and solubility values of the studied gases for the PBI and PBI-silica composite membranes at different weight fractions of silica particles. Fig. 8 represents the permeability results of the gases in pure and composite membranes where in the latter case; the permeabilities were measured with respect to the silica content of the polymer. As can be elucidated from Fig. 8, the permeability of gases in pure PBI membrane varies in the following order:CO2>N2>CH4 The difference observed in the permeability results of the membranes can be explained through the solution-diffusion mechanism [39]. As mentioned earlier, PBI is an amorphous glassy polymer and as a result the diffusion is the dominant mechanism in permeation of gases through the polymer matrix in this case. Moreover, the data reported in Table 2 suggests that, the order of the diffusivity of the gases in PBI and PBI-silica nano-composite membranes is the same as the order observed in the permeability. The diffusivity is dependent on the kinetic diameter of the permeant gases through the membranes so that the diffusivity of a gas is increased upon the reduction of the kinetic diameter of the gas. So CO2, with the smallest molecular size compared to other gases, has the highest and CH4 with the largest molecular size has the lowest permeability. Comparison of the permeability of CO2, CH4 and N2 gases in hybrid membranes leads to the following order:CO2>CH4>N2 As can be seen in Table 2, the order of the gas permeabilities in the composite membranes is similar to the order of solubility coefficient of gases in membranes. Increasing the gas condensability, leads to the enhancement of the interactions and solubility of the gas in the polymer matrix and ultimately results in an increase in the gas solubility factor of the polymer. This confirms the dominancy of the solution mechanism in the permeation of gases through the composite membranes. So it can be concluded that the incorporation of silica nano particles into the polymer matrix, enhances the solubility of the gases in the membrane and also increases the permeation of the condensable gases in the PBI-silica composite membranes, hence, changing the dominant gas permeation mechanism from the diffusion mechanism to the solution one. As can be observed in Fig. 8, the permeability of CO2 gas through the composite PBI-silica membrane, significantly increases in comparison with the pure polymer. The permeability of CO2 increases from 0.025 Barrer in pure PBI to 0.11 Barrer in the composite membrane containing 20 wt% silica particles. The results of the permeability of the CH4 gas in pure and composite membranes indicate a slight increase in the permeability of methane from 0.005 Barrer to 0.010 Barrer. However, Nitrogen gas, exhibits an opposite trend compared to the previously mentioned results. Incorporation of silica particles in the polymer matrix, results in a significant decrease in the permeability of N2 from 0.007 Barrer in PBI to 0.002 Barrer in PBI-S20. This is due to the reduction of gas diffusivity in the polymer matrix. Investigation of the obtained results (Table 2) reveals that increasing the silica content in the membranes, leads to the reduction of the diffusivity for all of the gases applied in this study. This reduction is actually related to the restricted motion of the gas molecules in the polymer matrix and formation of pathways with more tortuosity in the polymer due to the presence of silica particles. As can be inferred from the results of the WAXD studies, the presence of silica domains in the polymer matrix, has not any noticeable influence on the crystallinity of the polymer since the broad peak which may belong to the small crystallinities, does not change significantly by increasing the silica content. This implies that the silica domain is distributed in the amorphous region hence, lengthening the gas diffusion pathways in the membrane. On the other hand, the increased permeability of the condensable CO2 and CH4 gases is mainly related to the enhancement of gas solubility due to increasing of the active sites for gas solution in polymer matrix. The comparison of the solubility factors of the gases under study in PBI and PBI-silica composite membranes indicates an increase in the solubility of CO2 and CH4 gases of 17 and 15 times, respectively. The solubility factor of the Nitrogen gas shows an increase of only 2.7 times. Incorporation of silica particles in the polymer membrane increases the density of polar OH groups in the matrix, forming polar sites and cavities at the polymer-silica interface and also the morphological changes occurred at the silica-polymer interface which aids the solution of the condensable gases in the membrane. Kim et al., suggested that the increased permeability of the condensable gases in comparison with other gases is due to the morphological changes occurring at the interface between silica and polymer which ultimately results in an enhancement in the amorphous region in the composite membrane [9]. According to the obtained diffusivity and solubility results of the gases in the PBI-silica composite membranes, it can be concluded that silica particles do not play any special role on the reduction of packing density of the polymer chains even if they are able to restrict the gas diffusion paths. However, the presence of silica domains in the polymer matrix can result in the formation of more sites for the solution of condensable gases so as to increase the solubility of the condensable gases in the membrane. Therefore, the effect of silica particles on the PBI membrane can be summarized as follows:•The presence of silica particles in the polymer matrix results in a decrease in the permeability of the gases since they restrain the diffusion of the gases through the polymer matrix due to increasing the tortuosity of the matrix.•Incorporation of the silica particles into the polymer matrix enhances the solubility of the condensable and polar gases in the polymer by increasing the number of polar OH groups and also by modifying the morphology at the interface between the two phases. The presence of silica particles in the polymer matrix results in a decrease in the permeability of the gases since they restrain the diffusion of the gases through the polymer matrix due to increasing the tortuosity of the matrix. Incorporation of the silica particles into the polymer matrix enhances the solubility of the condensable and polar gases in the polymer by increasing the number of polar OH groups and also by modifying the morphology at the interface between the two phases. Fig. 9 illustrates the variation of the selectivities in the gas pairs of CO2 / CH4 and CO2 / N2 with increasing the silica content in the polymer. The comparison of the selectivities of CO2 / CH4 indicates an increase in this quantity from 4.96 in pure polymer to 11.4 in the composite membrane containing 20 wt% silica particles. As mentioned earlier, the polar OH groups are introduced to the polymer together with the inorganic materials. Carbon dioxide, as a polar gas, has a great tendency to the OH groups and therefore is much more soluble in the composite membrane compared to the non-polar methane gas and as a result exhibits a significant increase in its permeability value. Consequently, the selectivity of the CO2 / CH4 is slightly increased upon increasing the silica content while for CO2 / N2, the increase in the selectivity is much more significant and increases from 3.5 in the pure polymer to 71.3 in the composite membrane containing 20 wt% silica particles. As stated before, the permeability of nitrogen through the PBI-silica nano-composite membrane is reduced upon increasing the silica content whereas that of CO2 gas demonstrates a considerable increase due to the high interaction of the gas molecules with the polar OH groups as well as increasing the solubility of the gas in the composite membrane.

As shown in this figure the solubility coefficients correlated well (R^2 > 0.985) with condensability of the gases. In case of pure PBI, this correlation was weaker (R^2 = 0.79). Fig. 10 also shows that the slope of ln(S) versus Tc in hybrid membranes is 3-3.6 times higher than pure PBI membrane. This observation confirms the increasing of solubility of gases in the membranes by increasing the amount of silica particles in membrane. The variations of the diffusion coefficient (ln D) of penetrants as a function of their kinetic diameter (as plotted in Fig. 11), showed a good correlation for membranes (R^2 > 0.95) except PBI-S16 (R^2 = 0.92) and PBI-S20 (R^2 = 0.93) specimens which show weaker correlation. The weaker correlation of the diffusivity coefficient for these two membranes may be due to the results obtained for nitrogen gas. Since the permeability of nitrogen in these two membranes is at the minimum level, the test procedure may contain some inaccuracies; hence the calculated diffusion coefficient would be more erroneous. Comparison and further investigation of the ln(D) versus kinetic diameter curves reveals that the slope of the curves vary in following order:PBI<PBI-S2<PBI-S5<PBI-S9<PBI-S16≈PBI-S20-1.7<-2.4<-2.59<-2.92<-3.2≈-3.18 From the obtained results, it can be concluded that the diffusivity of the gases with bigger size molecules has been more restricted by increasing the silica nano particle content of the hybrid membranes.

697,Enhancement of the gas separation properties of polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane by incorporation of silica nano particles.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Modeling of gas permeability in hybrid membranes']"," As mentioned earlier in the theory section, various models can be utilized in order to predict the gas permeation in hybrid membranes. One of the models that is used for the prediction of the permeability in membranes wherein spherical particles are randomly distributed in a polymer matrix, is Higuchi model. In the case of PBI-silica hybrid membranes, since the silica particles are impermeable, the β parameter turns to-0.5. By incorporation of β parameter the Higuchi model turns to:(10)PeffPc=1-6Φ4+2Φ-KH(1-Φ) As shown by Higuchi and other similar models, incorporation of impermeable silica particles in a polymer membrane reduces the permeability of gases compared to the pure polymer. However, the experimental results show higher permeabilities in the case of CO2 and CH4 gases upon incorporation of silica nano particles as a result of the changes occurring in the polymer-silica interface and also due to the enhancement of the gas solubility. The results obtained by other researchers also verifies the same trend, i.e. an increase in the gas permeability in hybrid membranes due to the morphology changes occured at the polymer-silica interfaces [16], [26]. While the permeability of nitrogen is reduced upon increasing the silica content, the Higuchi model was employed for modeling the permeability behavior of this gas in hybrid membranes. By incorporation of nitrogen permeability instead of Pc, Eq. (10) turns to:(11)Peff=0.00705-0.0423Φ4+2Φ-KH(1-Φ) As mentioned earlier, the term KH in Eq. (11) is considered as an empirical constant with an assigned value of 0.78 on the basis of experimental data [33]. There is no significant correlation between model and experimental results supposing KH = 0.78 in the model. However, using a least square method, the model fitted very well to the experimental data and the best value for KH was calculated. The obtained results suggest the values of 3.8 and 0.97 for KH and R^2 respectively in order to make an acceptable correlation between the experimental data and Higuchi model. Fig. 12 shows the correlation of Higuchi model to the experimental data based on KH = 3.8. Such an increase in the value of KH is related to the nano size distribution of silica particles in hybrid membranes. By decreasing the size of particles to the nano scale, the effect of impermeability of silica particles is more highlighted, due to the enhancement of the specific surface area of the particles. Thus the KH constant which is closely related to the amount of permeability, is increased. As a result, it can be concluded that the Higuchi model can make a more realistic prediction about the permeability of gases in nanocomposite polymer-silica membranes, if the KH constant in this model is increased to higher values between 3 and 4. The new general value of KH for these types of hybrid membranes could be extracted by fitting more experimental data to the model. The completion of this model would be pursued in future works. "

The performance of the pure PBI membrane in the separation of CO2 gas, is located under the desirable performance line of the membranes; however, as can be seen, incorporation of silica particles, significantly improves the performance of this membrane type and sets its position in the efficient and desirable area. According the above-mentioned results, incorporation of silica particles into the PBI-silica polymer, significantly increases the efficiency of this membrane type in the separation of CO2 gas respect to N2. This, along with the unique physical, mechanical and chemical properties of PBI, makes it an appropriate choice as far as the industrial applications are concerned. "

The results of the gas permeability experiments indicated an increase in the permeability of CO2 and CH4 and a decrease in the permeability of N2 upon increasing the silica content of the polymer membrane. Furthermore, the obtained results revealed the fact that incorporation of silica particles in the polymer matrix, i.e. increasing the number of polar OH groups as well as morphological changes induced at the silica-PBI interface, leads to the enhancement of the gas solubility in such membranes, while the diffusivity of the gases in the nano-composite membrane is reduced due to the obstructions made by the particles. According to the results of the permeability and selectivity experiments, a 20 wt% increase in the silica content of the polymer membrane results in a 4.5 times increase in permeability of CO2 and 20 times increase in selectivity of CO2 / N2. The solubility coefficients correlated well with condensability of gases and the slope of ln(S) versus Tc in hybrid membranes were 3-3.6 times higher than pure PBI membrane. The diffusion coefficient (ln D) of penetrants showed a good correlation to their kinetic diameter.

The thermal stability was not significantly affected by the presence of plasticizer and / or the addition of clays. The water sorption isotherms and water sorption kinetics were studied and modelled as a function of the composition of the films. The sorption mechanism was complex and resulted from a combination of different contributions involving the interactions between the plasticizer, the matrix and the nanoclays. The introduction of nanoclays led to decrease the oxygen permeability. This decrease seemed to be more efficient in presence of glycerol. "

707,Experimental and modelling studies of transport in starch nanocomposite films as affected by relative humidity.xml,['Introduction']," In the last decade, a growing interest has been paid on the use of biodegradable polymers from renewable resources in order to reduce the environmental impact, especially for packaging applications. In the family of renewable resources based on biodegradable polymeric materials, starch has been considered as one of the most promising materials because of wide availability, attractive combination of price, performance and very fast biodegradability [1], [2], [3]. Starch is the major form of carbohydrate in plants. It is a semicrystalline polymer composed of a mixture of amylose, an essentially linear polysaccharide, and amylopectin, a highly branched polysaccharide. The relative amount of amylose and amylopectin depends on the plant source [4]. Starch based materials have received great attention for packaging applications as they exhibit low oxygen permeability at dry state. Nevertheless, pure native starch films are brittle. Plasticizers are then often added to improve the polymer flexibility by weakening the polymer chains intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Plasticizers are generally more efficient as their structure resemble more closely to that one of the polymer to be plasticized [5]. So, the plasticizers that are the most commonly used with starch are polyols such as glycerol [6], [7]. Despite their enhanced mechanical properties, plasticized starch based films cannot meet all the requirements of packaging applications. In particular, these materials remain water sensitive and, therefore, lose their barrier properties upon hydration [8], [9]. In this context, the nanocomposites concept can be a promising option as it could lead to decrease the initial gas permeability of the plasticized film as well as to keep a low oxygen flux upon hydration. As reported in studies concerning various synthetic polymers, inorganic lamellar fillers like nanoclays can improve polymer gas and water barrier properties at rather low content due to their high aspect ratio [10], [11], [12]. The barrier properties enhancement depends on a great part on the clay dispersion state and exfoliated structures are recognised as the most efficient ones for barrier properties. Some studies have also shown that strong interactions between the impermeable fillers and the polymer could benefit the permeability reduction due to the formation of a low diffusive filler / matrix interphase [13]. It is then of great interest to adapt the nanofiller surface properties considering the nature of the polymer matrix. That is why organo-modified clays are often used with synthetic polymers whereas pristine clay seems to be more suitable for starch and plasticized starch films in relation to their high polarity [14], [15]. Despite the existence of an extensive work describing gas barrier and structural properties for the most widely synthetic polymer based nanocomposites, there is a lack of proper understanding of the transport properties in natural polymer based nanocomposites such as starch and plasticized starch based nanocomposites. The aim of this current work was to prepare two nanocomposites films series from a natural montmorillonite for a nanofiller amount lower than 7.5 wt.% . The first series was based on neat starch, and the second one on 20 wt.% glycerol plasticized starch. The nanoclay dispersion state was first studied as a function of the film composition, i.e. plasticizer and clay amounts, respectively. Water sorption and water diffusivity were then examined as a function of the matrix composition, clay loading and equilibrium relative humidity. A detailed analysis of the water sorption mechanism was proposed on the basis of water sorption and diffusion modelling. Oxygen permeation was studied for the different films in the range of relative humidity going from 35 to 90% . Here again, a detailed analysis of the permeability coefficients was proposed. For this purpose, a particular attention was paid on the evolution of the cohesive energy density of the medium as a function of the nanocomposite composition and water content in the film. It was shown that water and oxygen could be used as complementary probes to study in detailed by an original way the polymer and nanocomposites architecture. "

The nanoclays content in the films was 0, 2.5 and 7.5 wt.% , respectively and was expressed relatively to the total matter content including glycerol for plasticized system. For the reference matrices, the film preparation consisted of the dissolution of starch with or without plasticizer in distilled water at a concentration of 3 wt.% . The solutions were heated to the gelatinisation temperature (85 °C) and continuously stirred at this temperature for 1 h. The resulting solutions were poured in polystyrene petri dishes and water evaporation was carried out at ambient temperature. The reference films were named S and SG for the pure starch based film and the glycerol plasticized starch based film, respectively.

The resulting mixture was heated at 85 °C for 5 h under continuous stirring. The subsequent casting and water evaporation steps were carried out under the same conditions as those that were used for the reference films. In all cases, the films were conditioned at 25 °C and 40% equilibrium relative humidity between two sheets of polyethylene for three weeks before film characterization. The thickness of the films was approximately 50 μm as the average value of 6 measurements for each film. The nanocomposites were named S X wt.% MMT or SG X wt.% MMT, X being the weight amount of clay within the nanocomposites. "

The film was placed on an aluminium mask with an open testing area of 5 cm^2. The test cell was composed of two chambers separated by the film. Nitrogen containing 2% of hydrogen was used as the carrier gas and pure oxygen was used as the test gas. The equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) of the two gases was controlled by a humidifier. Prior to testing, specimens were conditioned in nitrogen / hydrogen inside the unit for at least 48 h to remove traces of atmospheric oxygen. The apparent oxygen transmission rate under N2 / H2 was measured to give information on the background count due to leaks in the system. Subsequently, oxygen was introduced in the upstream compartment of the test cell. Oxygen transferred through the film was conducted by the carrier N2 / H2 gas to the coulometric sensor. Measurements were made when oxygen flux was stabilised indicating that the steady state was reached. The permeability coefficient in cm^3(STP) μm / (m^2 day atm) was calculated on the basis of oxygen transmission in steady state taking into account the thickness of the films. Oxygen permeability measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure (P = 1 atm), and controlled temperature (T = 25 °C) for five levels of equilibrium relative humidity (ERH = 35, 45, 60, 70, and 85% , respectively).

At the heart of the DVS system is an ultra-sensitive recording microbalance capable of measuring changes in sample mass. This type of microbalance had very good long-term stability and was therefore ideally suited to the measurement of vapour sorption phenomena, which may take from minutes to days to achieve equilibrium. The vapour partial pressure (P) was controlled by mixing dry and saturated nitrogen, using electronic mass flow controllers. The experiments were carried out at 25 °C for water vapour activities, aw, ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 (aw = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9, respectively). The initial weight of the samples was approximately 50 mg. The samples were pre-dried in the DVS Advantage by exposure to dry nitrogen until the dry weight of the samples was obtained. A partial pressure of water was established within the apparatus and the water uptake was followed as a function of time. The equilibrium was considered to be reached when changes in mass with time (dm / dt) were lower than 0.0002 for 5 consecutive minutes. After, the water activity was increased automatically to the target value and equilibrated using the same dm / dt criterion (0.0002 for 5 consecutive minutes). "
715,Experimental and modelling studies of transport in starch nanocomposite films as affected by relative humidity.xml,"['Theory', 'Sorption model']"," The relationship between the concentration of water in the material (C) at constant temperature and the water activity (aw) is described by the water sorption isotherm. Water activity is defined as:(1)aw=PPsat=ERH100where P is the vapour pressure of water in equilibrium with the material at any given temperature, Psat is the saturated pressure of pure water at the same temperature and ERH is the equilibrium relative humidity (% ). C can be expressed in cm^3 STP per g of material according to the following equation:(2)C=Mw(eq)-MdMd×2241418where Mw(eq) is the mass of dry matter plus the mass of water molecules sorbed at equilibrium and Md is the mass of dry matter. The mathematical description of the sorption isotherms can bring useful information concerning the sorption mode and the interactions involved in the sorption process [16], [17]. Several models have already been used to describe sigmoidal type isotherms. These models are classified into three different groups [18]: (i) empirical models (like Smith, Oswin and Peleg models), (ii) semi-empirical models (like Ferro-Fontan, Henderson and Halsey models) and (iii) models based on a multi-layer approach (Modified-BET model and GAB model) [19]. Park has proposed a new model which offers a detailed description of sorption phenomena by expressing the concentration of water in polymer, C, versus the water activity, aw [20]. This model comprises three terms:(3)C=AL⋅bL⋅aw1+bL⋅aw+kH⋅aw+Ka.kHnn⋅awn The first term describes Langmuir sorption which leads to a plateau of concentration when water activity increases, corresponding to the saturation of the specific sites of sorption. The second term gives a water concentration which increases linearly with water activity (Henry's law). The third term is a power function which represents the water aggregation phenomenon. Park's model needs five parameters to be defined: Langmuir's terms, AL, (Langmuir capacity constant) and bL (Langmuir affinity constant) have an influence in the first step of water sorption, at low water activity. Henry's solubility coefficient, kH, defines the slope of the isotherm in the second zone. The two last parameters, Ka, the equilibrium constant for the clustering reaction and, n, the mean number of water molecules per cluster can be linked to the equilibrium state corresponding to the aggregate formation in the last zone at high water activity:z H2O ⇔ z / n(H2O)^nwith z, the total number of water molecules sorbed. To evaluate the accuracy of Park model to describe the experimental water sorption isotherms of our different films, the mean relative percentage deviation modulus (E) was used. It is defined by:(4)E=100N∑i=1Nmi-mpimiwhere mi is the experimental value, mpi is the predicted value, and N is the number of experimental data. The mean relative percentage deviation modulus (E) is widely adopted through the literature, and a modulus value below 10% indicates a good fit practical purpose [21]. We calculated the parameters of Park's model by fitting according to the software Tablecurve 2D (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Therefore, each isotherm was described analytically by Park's equation. "
716,Experimental and modelling studies of transport in starch nanocomposite films as affected by relative humidity.xml,"['Theory', 'Diffusivity']"," Diffusion is a process by which small molecules, water in our case, are transported from one part of a system to another one as a result of random molecular motions [22]. Fick first puts diffusion on a quantitative mathematical equation:(5)J(x,t)=-D∂C(x,t)∂xwhere J(x,t) is the rate of transfer per unit area of section, C is the concentration of water in the material, x is the space coordinate measured normal to the section, and D is the diffusion coefficient. This equation is known as the Fick's first law of diffusion [23]. If the diffusion coefficient is constant and the concentration gradient is only along the x-axis, then the fundamental differential equation of diffusion is as follows:(6)∂C(x,t)∂t=-∂J(x,t)∂x This equation is known as the Fick's second law [24]. Eqs. (7), (8) are good approximate solutions of diffusion laws for respectively short time (Mt / Meq < 0.5) and long time (Mt / Meq > 0.5) of sorption [25].(7)MtMeq=4LDtπ(8)ln1-MtMeq=ln8π2-π2DtL2where Mt is the mass sorbed at time t, Meq is the mass sorbed at equilibrium state and L is the thickness of the film. For small times (Mt / Meq < 0.5), a plot of Mt / Meq versus t would have a slope of 4 D^0.5 / L π^0.5. The major problem with using this approach is that the experimental data obtained in the initial uptake stage are less accurate. A sigmoid beginning of the experimental sorption can often be observed and makes very imprecise the use of linearization based upon equation. This phenomenon can be explained by finite time to change the vapour pressure of water and experimental limitations of apparatus. D was then determined from the plot of ln(1-Mt / Meq) as a function of t for Mt / Meq > 0.5 using Eq. (8). The slope of the curve is linked to water diffusion coefficient by the following relationship:(9)D=k×L2π2where k is the slope of the curve and L is the thickness of the film. "

Fig. 1a presents the weight loss curves relative to the reference and nanocomposite un-plasticized films and Fig. 1b shows the curves associated to the plasticized films. The weight loss curve of the montmorillonite was also reported on these figures. As shown in Fig. 1, the thermal stability of the nanoclay was very important. For un-plasticized starch based films, Fig. 1a, two weight losses were observed on the thermograms. The first one between 50 and 180 °C corresponded to water loss, and the second one at around 300 °C corresponded to starch decomposition. The degradation mechanism consisted of the elimination of polyhydroxyl groups, accompanied by depolymerization and decomposition, with the final production of carbon [26]. For plasticized starch based films (Fig. 1b), an additional weight loss assigned to the volatilization of the plasticizer was observed. This phenomenon occurred between 100 and 260 °C. No significant difference was found in the thermal stability of starch in presence of glycerol or / and after the incorporation of the nanoclays. Indeed, the values of the degradation temperatures, Tmax, deduced from the maximum of the derivate weight / temperature curve, were equal to 320±1 °C for all materials. A plateau was observed after starch decomposition on the mass loss curves of each system. The plateau value was directly associated to the final production of carbon and the content of montmorillonite. The amount of inorganic phase in each composite was deduced from the weight residues measured at 700 °C on the nanocomposites and the respective matrices. As this inorganic phase was directly associated with the fillers, it was possible to calculate the experimental content of montmorillonite in each nanocomposite [27]. The experimental loading of nanoclays was 2.0 and 7.3 wt.% for un-plasticized starch based films and 2.5 and 6.6 wt.% for plasticized starch based films. "

719,Experimental and modelling studies of transport in starch nanocomposite films as affected by relative humidity.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Morphology']"," XRD analyses were performed on the two different reference matrices and associated nanocomposites. The XRD patterns are presented in Fig. 2. The diffraction diagrams of the reference matrices corresponded to a typical XRD pattern of potato starch (B-type) [28], [29], [30]. The diffraction peaks observed for native potato starch at 2θ = 5.6, 15.2, 17.2, 19.8, and 22.5 °, were related to complex structures characteristic of starch tubers, such as B-type crystals. As seen in a previous work, the presence of 20 wt.% plasticizer in the system did not drastically modify the crystalline structure of starch films [31]. After the incorporation of the nanoclays in the reference matrices, it was interesting to check, on one hand, the crystallinity of the matrix by analysing the XRD spectra for 2θ range from 10 to 30 ° and, on the other hand, to study the state of dispersion of the fillers by focussing on the 2θ range from 1 to 10 °. However, we had to keep in mind here that the characteristic peak of the B-type starch structure observed at 2θ = 5.6 ° for all of the matrices should complicate the analysis of the clay dispersion state within the polymer phase. That is why TEM analysis was also performed for the different nanocomposites. The XRD patterns of the matrices and associated composites films are shown in Fig. 2a and b for S and SG, respectively. For both systems, no noteworthy difference was observed in the 2θ range from 10 to 30 ° after the incorporation of the nanoclays, and this whatever the amount of MMT. Then, the nanoclays did not modify the matrix crystalline morphology. The 2θ range between 1 and 10 ° was examined in order to get insight on the dispersion state of the nanoclays within the different matrices. Indeed the XRD pattern of the MMT in powder form (Fig. 2), showed a low diffraction peak at 2θ = 7.6 ° corresponding to an interplatelet distance (d0 0 1) equal to 11.7 Å. The filler diffraction peak should, in theory, (i) be shifted to lower values of 2θ for intercalated clay structures within the matrix, (ii) totally disappear for an exfoliated clay structure, and (iii) stay at the same position in the case of micro-composite formation. The XRD patterns of the starch based nanocomposites films showed the presence of a broad double diffraction peak in the 2θ range between 1 and 10 °. This peak was shifted to lower 2θ values in comparison with the neat montmorillonite. This double peak should result from the contribution of the matrix crystallinity (at 2θ = 5.6 °) but also from the contribution of a high polydispersity in the nanofiller interplatelet distance. Indeed the diffraction peak intensity increased as the nanoclay content increased in the film. From XRD analyses we could then conclude that intercalated structures were mainly obtained independently on the nanoclay amount within the matrix. This result was confirmed by the TEM observations. Fig. 3a and c is representative of the TEM images of starch nanocomposites with 2.5 and 7.5 wt.% of nanoclays, respectively. In all samples, small platelets stacks parallel to the film surface were mainly observed in addition to few single platelets indicating in fact a mixture of intercalated and exfoliated structures. The XRD patterns of the plasticized starch based nanocomposites films showed an intense diffraction peak at 2θ equal to 4.9 °. The magnitude of the diffraction peak increased also with the clay content. This peak totally masked the contribution of the matrix crystalline phase at 2θ = 5.6 ° and it could be assigned to intercalated clays. Indeed the peak position corresponded to an interplatelet distance (d0 0 1) equal to 18.0 Å. This peak has been already observed by several authors and is commonly attributed to the uptake of glycerol into the clay galleries indicative of a more ordered structure [32], [33], [34]. However, as for starch based systems, TEM images, in Fig. 3b and d, evidenced a uniform dispersion of single platelets and small platelet stacks that were all oriented parallel to the film surface. The rather good dispersion of MMT observed in the two reference matrices could be attributed to the key interaction between the sodium ion located in the intergallery space of the nanoclay and the hydroxyl groups of starch making a very compatible system [35].

722,Experimental and modelling studies of transport in starch nanocomposite films as affected by relative humidity.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Water sorption isotherms', 'Experimental data']"," Sorption isotherm curves were obtained by plotting, the concentration of sorbed water (C) versus the water activity (aw). The sorption isotherms for the native starch film and for the plasticized starch film are presented in Fig. 4a. A sigmoidal shape corresponding to type IV sorption mode in the classification of Rogers or B.E.T. II in the classification of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller was clearly observed for starch film [36], [37]. This curve shape was usually obtained for many hydrophilic materials [38], [39], [40]. The sorption isotherm had a slightly sigmoidal shape for plasticized starch film. As generally observed, at low water activity, plasticized starch film sorbed a lower water content than neat starch film due to a decrease of available sorption sites [41]. Indeed OH groups of glycerol could form hydrogen bonds with OH groups of starch, which led to decrease the amount of sorption sites. At high water activity, SG-film sorbed a higher water content than S-film due to the enhanced molecular mobility of the polymer chains in the presence of plasticizer. Indeed and as already explained, glycerol is a small polar molecule which presents a high capacity to interact with starch chains, weakening the initial polymer intra and inter molecular hydrogen bonds. A subsequent enhancement of the molecular mobility and increase of the free volume is then observed [42]. In order to investigate the contribution of nanoclays in nanocomposite water sorption mechanism, water adsorption experiments were first performed on MMT. The water sorption isotherm deduced from the data (Fig. 4a) showed that MMT presented a significant water adsorption capacity. This result could be explained by the hydrophilic character of the filler mainly related to the presence of the Na^+ cation in the intergallery space. This nanoclay should then be able to participate in the general moisture sorption process of the nanocomposite even if its water adsorption capacity was lower than that of the reference matrices. The sorption isotherms for matrices and associated composites are represented in Fig. 4b and c for S and SG, respectively. The shape of the nanocomposites water sorption isotherms was similar to that of the reference matrices, showing that the sorption mechanism was mainly governed by the polymer matrix. For starch based films reinforced by MMT, whatever the nanoclay loading, the water sorption isotherms were superimposable and the moisture content was lower than that of the reference matrix in the whole range of water activity. It could be noted that the water uptake was lower than that calculated considering the contribution of each component by mean of an additive law. It could then be concluded that some of the sorption sites born by each component were not available for water sorption in the blend, probably due to their involvement in the formation of starch / nanoclay interactions. For SG based nanocomposites, the water uptake was not significantly modified at low activity by the introduction of nanoclays. However, at high water activity, the water content was slightly higher in the nanocomposites than in the reference matrix. This phenomenon could be explained by the role of the plasticizer which led to an enhancement of segmental motion. This increased mobility allowed a better accessibility of the water molecules to the hydrophilic sites of the nanoclays and it favoured water clusters formation at high water activity. However, the moisture content was higher with 2.5 wt.% MMT than with 7.5 wt.% MMT showing that the free volume was restricted as the nanoclays content increased. In conclusion, the sorption mechanism resulted from different contributions that could lead to opposite effects. The first one concerned the matrix and the nanoclays sorption sites which could participate to the moisture content when they were not already involved in interactions towards each other. It should be noticed here the initial lower adsorption capacity of the clays in comparison with the matrix. The second one concerned a modification of the matrix behaviour in the presence of a significant nanoclays amount, due to geometrical constraints and to a modification of the polymer chain mobility at high loading. It seemed that the critical filler amount to be reached to observe this last phenomenon was as more high as the initial matrix mobility was important. In conclusion, for starch based system, the initial relatively low swelling capacity of the matrix associated to the formation of starch / nanoclay interactions led to a decrease of the water content in comparison with the neat matrix as soon as low amounts of clays were introduced. For plasticized starch based systems, the initial high mobility of the matrix favoured water sorption at low filler amount. The tendency was only inverted at 7.5 wt.% of clays. "

Examination of fitting data, E and r^2, indicated that Park's model could describe the experimental sorption isotherms with a good accuracy. The Langmuir's terms, AL and bL, were lower for SG based films than for S based film due to a decrease in the concentration of available polar sites in the plasticized films as explained previously. The presence of nanoclays did not have a significant effect on these parameters except in the case of starch based films, for which a slight decrease of bL was observed in comparison with the reference matrix. This variation could be related to the formation of nanoclay / starch interactions. The kH parameter defined as the random absorption of the water molecules in the materials was systematically slightly higher for SG based films than for S based films. This evolution could be explained by the higher polymer chain mobility and free volume in the plasticized films. From a general point of view, the presence of nanoclays led to a decrease of kH value which was slightly accentuated by the nanoclays content. Concerning the aggregate parameter's, the mean number of water molecules forming an aggregate, n, was in the same order of magnitude, around 6.7±0.4 for all films. However, the equilibrium constant, Ka, was higher for S based films compared to SG based films. This result traduced a similar number of water molecules per cluster but a higher ability to form the water clusters in the plasticized S based films than in SG based films. Concerning now, the more specific influence of the nanoclays, it could be observed that introduction of nanoclays led to opposite behaviours as a function of the matrix. Indeed in starch based films, the nanoclays did not have an important effect on the water aggregation phenomenon. On the contrary, Ka values increased when the amount of nanoclays increased in plasticized starch films, showing that in this case, the water aggregation phenomenon was favoured. We could then conclude that Ka was the parameter that was the most sensitive to the nanoclay contribution. Another major result of the modelling was that, in all films, the size of the water clusters remained the same since no significant variation of n values were observed. "

726,Experimental and modelling studies of transport in starch nanocomposite films as affected by relative humidity.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Sorption kinetics']"," The diffusion coefficients values are reported for different activities in Table 2. It could be observed that, for a given system, the diffusion rate was not constant in all the range of activity, meaning that D was dependent on the amount of water molecules sorbed by the films. The water diffusion coefficient values were plotted as a function of the concentration of water sorbed at equilibrium Ceq in a semi-logarithmic scale ln(D) = f(C) (Fig. 5). The same general shape of curve was observed whatever the system. The water diffusion first increased and then decreased. These variations were in agreement with the water sorption mechanism complying with the model of Park. At low water activity, the increase of water diffusion could be explained by the dual mode sorption: the first water molecules sorbed in Langmuir's sites were partially or totally immobilized and next the Henry's sorption contribution became predominant, so that water diffusivity increased due to further molecular mobility. Due to increased water concentration in the material, a plasticization phenomenon could also be observed. This phenomenon could be described by the following relationship:(10)D=D0⋅exp(γC)where D0 is the limit diffusion coefficient defined at nil concentration and can give information on the microstructure of the materials, γ is the plasticization coefficient, and C is the concentration of water molecules in the material. The parameters of Eq. (10), D0, and γ were deduced from a linear regression of the curve at low water concentration. Their values are reported in Table 3. At high activity, the decrease of water diffusion coefficient observed on the plot of ln(D) versus concentration could be attributed to the water clustering phenomenon [43], [44], [45], [46]. This anti-plasticization phenomenon could be expressed by the following relation:(11)D=Dagg.exp(-βC)where Dagg is the limit diffusion aggregation coefficient at nil concentration. β is the anti-plasticization coefficient, and C is the concentration of water molecules in the material. The parameters of the aggregate phenomenon, Dagg and β, were calculated using a linear regression of the decreasing part of the curve ln(D) = f(C). The values of β are presented in Table 3. The values of Dagg were not reported because the aggregation phenomenon did not begin at nil concentration. The water diffusion properties in the different films are discussed as a function of the film composition and as a function of the activity range on the basis of the experimental diffusion data reported in Fig. 5 and Table 2 and on the basis of theoretical diffusion data of Table 3. In the range of low activity, typically below 0.3 (C < 80 cm^3 STP g^-1), the water diffusion coefficients were systematically higher for the plasticized films than for the respective un-plasticized films. The same tendency was observed on the limit diffusion coefficient defined at nil concentration, D0, which represented the diffusion of the first water molecules in the materials in absence of concentration dependency. This result could be explained firstly by a lower concentration of Langmuir's sites, AL, for SG based films and secondly by an increase of the polymer chain mobility in presence of plasticizer. For all films, the water diffusion rate increased as the amount of sorbed water increased from 0 to about 80 cm^3 STP g^-1 and only slightly higher values of γ were determined in this domain for un-plasticized starch based films than to plasticized ones, showing that the plasticization mechanism evidenced at low water concentration was practically identical and did not depend on the presence of the plasticizer or of the clays. In the middle range of activity, i.e. for 0.3 < aw < 0.5 (80 < C < 160 cm^3 STP g^-1), plasticized and un-plasticized films series exhibited two distinct behaviours. Indeed, the water diffusion rate decreased for the glycerol plasticized films whereas it continued to slightly increase for the S based films. The decrease of D value began on this film series at an activity equal to 0.5. According to these data and in agreement with the shape of the sorption isotherms, it seemed that the clustering phenomenon occurred at lower activity and for a lower amount of sorbed water for the SG based film series than for the S based films series (aw = 0.5 and C = 80 cm^3 STP g^-1 for SG film and aw = 0.6 and C = 160 cm^3 STP g^-1for S-film). It could also be observed that the values of D that were reached just before the beginning of the clustering phenomenon, thus the highest values of D, were similar in the S and SG based films, 50 × 10^-11 and 59 × 10^-11 cm^2 s^-1, respectively. It seemed then that in all these films series a maximum plasticization effect could be admissible. This effect was only due to water for S based films whereas in SG based films, the plasticization effect resulted from the contribution of the sorbed water molecules that was added to the initial plasticization effect brought by the plasticizer. This observation could explain why a lower amount of water was needed in SG systems to observe water aggregation phenomenon and a subsequent decrease of the water diffusion rate. As a consequence, for activity higher than 0.3, the values of the diffusion coefficient became more important for starch based films than for the respective glycerol plasticized starch based films. The anti-plasticization coefficient, β, was determined for each film from the linear regression of the decreasing part of the curve ln(D) = f(C). β values were only slightly lower for the plasticized starch based films than for the un-plasticized ones, showing that no significant differences could be distinguished in the clustering phenomenon as a function of the film composition. This behaviour could be supported by the fact that the water cluster sizes were similar in all the films. The specific effect of clays on the water diffusion could be evidenced in Fig. 5b and c. For each system, in the whole range of water activity, the shape of the curve relative to the nanocomposites was similar compared to that of the reference matrices. Only a shift of the curve was observed as a function of the nanoclay content. For both systems, the diffusion rate of water molecules increased when low amount of MMT, i.e. 2.5 wt.% , was introduced in the matrices. Increasing the amount of nanoclays from 2.5 to 7.5 wt.% led then to decrease the water diffusion coefficient. However, for glycerol plasticized starch based films, the water diffusion coefficient of the nanocomposites remained higher than that of the neat matrix at high activity. It seemed then that at low content, i.e. 2.5 wt.% , MMT did not bring any tortuosity effect but on the contrary favoured the water mobility in the film. This effect could probably be attributed to a decrease of the matrix cohesive energy density relative to the disruption of some polymer intra or inter molecular hydrogen bonds due to the presence of clay. Tortuosity was in fact only effective at higher MMT amount. However, in the glycerol plasticized starch matrix, water diffusion rates lower than those of the matrix were only obtained at low activity. At high activity, i.e. in the domain where the clustering phenomenon was observed, the water diffusion rate remained higher in the nanocomposite than in the neat matrix. This specific behaviour could be related to the initially high polymer chain mobility in SG based films. From all these results, it could be concluded that the water sorption mechanism was complex in these systems and resulted from a combination of different contributions involving the interactions between the plasticizer, the matrix and the clays, the availability and accessibility of the sorption's sites and the tortuosity induced by the nanoclays. According to our results, it seemed that it was more difficult to reduce the water sorption and diffusion by introduction of clays in an initially plasticized starch matrix due to the high sorption capacity and polymer chain mobility. It was also of a great importance to study the impact of glycerol and nanoclays on oxygen permeability in order to see if oxygen was sensitive to the same structural parameters as water and to study also the evolution of the gas transport as a function of the film hydration state.

730,Experimental and modelling studies of transport in starch nanocomposite films as affected by relative humidity.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Oxygen permeability']"," Oxygen permeability measurements were performed from 35 to 90% equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) at 25 °C. The permeability coefficient values are reported in Table 4 and they are also represented, for each system, as a function of the relative humidity in Fig. 6. The permeability coefficients of the reference matrices were in good agreement with those reported in the literature [9], [10]. The same general trend was observed for all the studied films: the oxygen permeability coefficient P(O2) increased slightly in the range of relative humidity from 30 to 45% and at higher activity, an exponential increase of oxygen permeability was observed. This variation could be related to the general water sorption mechanism discussed previously. Indeed at high water activity, the water sorption capacity strongly increased in the materials. Water clusters were formed leading to a drastic decrease of the cohesive energy density of the polymer medium. Thus a high increase of oxygen permeability was observed. From the results of Fig. 6, it could be observed that P(O2) was always higher for the plasticized starch based films compared to un-plasticized ones. To discuss more specifically the effect of the plasticizer on the gas transport properties, the permeability values of the plasticized films were divided to that ones of the respective un-plasticized films for 0, 2.5 and 7.5 wt.% MMT. The ratio values are reported as a function of the relative humidity in Fig. 7. As attended, these values were higher than 1 and similar trends were observed as a function of the relative humidity: a small and quasi linear increase of the permeability ratio was evidenced at moderate relative humidity (below 70% ERH) whereas a much higher increase was observed at higher hydration states. However, we could also observe that the permeability ratio decreased as the MMT amount increased in the films. This effect was particularly significant at high activity. Thus, using clays seemed to limit the role of the plasticizer on the gas transport properties especially at high relative humidity. In order to study more specifically the effect of the clays on the gas permeability, the data of Fig. 6 are examined. Whatever the matrix, introduction of nanoclays led to decrease P(O2). The reduction of the gas permeability increased as the filler amount increased within the matrix. MMT could then be considered as impermeable fillers for gas transport. Furthermore, as shown by the TEM micrographs (Fig. 3), the MMT layers were lying in the plane of the films, leading to a significant increase of the gas pathway by a tortuosity effect. As generally observed, the tortuosity increased as the MMT amount increased in the matrix. In order to know, if the nanoclay effect was similar whatever the matrix and whatever the relative humidity, the evolution of relative permeability (Pc / Pm) is represented in Fig. 8 for the different systems as a function of ERH. Pc and Pm were the permeability coefficients of the composite and the respective matrix, respectively. We could observe at first and in agreement with the previous discussion that the relative permeability decreased as the clay amount increased. However, the presence of nanoclays seemed to be more efficient in SG matrix than in starch matrix. Indeed, the relative permeability values were always lower for SG based films than for S based systems. This result could not be attributed to a difference in the clay dispersion state. Indeed according to DRX and TEM analyses, a mixture of exfoliated and intercalated structures was observed in all samples. It rather seemed that introduction of clays modified in a higher extent the cohesive energy density of pure starch, which represented initially a medium of very high compacity, in comparison with plasticized starch. Oxygen was furthermore much more sensitive than water vapour to these modifications since it could not, contrary to water, establish strong interactions towards the polar groups contained in the medium. In conclusion, the gas permeability decrease observed in the nanocomposites resulted from two opposite variations: (i) a decrease of the gas diffusion due to the tortuosity effect brought by the fillers (ii) an increase of the gas diffusion rate due to the weakening of the initial intra and inter molecular hydrogen bonds in the polymer medium after clay introduction. This second contribution was more important for pure starch matrix than for plasticized starch. Furthermore, the relative contribution of this second phenomenon became less important as the clay content and then the tortuosity effect increased. The relative permeability was also discussed as a function of the relative humidity. The relative permeability values depended in some extent on ERH. Indeed, Pc / Pm increased at intermediate values of ERH and then decreased. It could also be observed that the magnitude of the relative permeability variations was much lower at high clay content (7.5 wt.% MMT) with a relative permeability value close to 0.4 for the starch based films and close to 0.2 for the glycerol plasticized starch based films, whatever ERH values. Thus here again, the tortuosity effect seemed to be the predominant factor at high clay content. At low clay content, the effects of water on gas transport had also to be taken into account. These effects could not be considered as strictly equivalent for gas transport in the unfilled and respective filled material, explaining the relative permeability variation observed as a function of ERH.

735,Experimental and modelling studies of transport in starch nanocomposite films as affected by relative humidity.xml,['Conclusion']," Environmentally friendly composites were prepared via a solution / casting method from a natural potato starch matrix and a natural purified montmorillonite. The effect of clay loading in the range from 0 to 7.5 wt.% , as well as the influence of glycerol introduced at a fixed concentration, i.e., 20 wt.% of the polymer phase was studied. No significant difference in starch thermal stability was observed in presence of glycerol or after the incorporation of MMT. The favourable interactions established between the clay gallery and the hydroxyl groups of starch, were at the origin of the rather good clay dispersion state evidenced by XRD and TEM analyses. The water sorption mechanism was studied as a function of the composition of the films and modelled by Park equation, considering three sorption modes: Langmuir, Henry, aggregate sorption. It was shown that the water uptakes were the results of different contributions. The water sorption kinetics was investigated as a function of the water activity and of the film composition. For all systems, water diffusivity, D, first increased and then decreased as a function of the water activity. The difference observed between the films was that this optimum diffusivity value was reached at lower activity for the plasticized films in comparison to the un-plasticized ones. For neat starch, plasticization was only due to the amount of sorbed water whereas it combined the effect of sorbed water in addition to the initial plasticization effect of glycerol for the plasticized films. The specific effect of clays on the water diffusion was an increase of the water diffusion rate at low clay amount followed by a decrease of water diffusivity at high clay content. However, for the plasticized starch based films, at high activity, the water diffusion rate remained higher in the highly loaded nanocomposites than in the matrix. According to our results, it seemed that it was more difficult to limit the water sorption and diffusion by introduction of clays in an initially plasticized starch matrix due to its initially high swelling capacity and high chain mobility. Oxygen permeability was studied for a wide range of relative humidity and the following general trends were observed. For all films, the permeability coefficient slightly increased in the range of relative humidity between 30 to 45% and highly increased at higher activities. The permeability of the plasticized films was systematically higher than that of the un-plasticized ones. Introducing clays led to decrease the gas permeability whatever the matrix. However, despite these general evolutions, some specific trends were observed as a function of the film composition. In particular, using clays seemed to limit the role of the plasticizer, glycerol, on the gas transport properties by limiting the gas flux. Furthermore, it seemed that the introduction of a low amount of clays modified in a higher extent the cohesive energy density of pure starch that initially represented a medium of high compacity in comparison with plasticized starch. From all our results, it could be concluded that due to their different interaction capacity, water and oxygen could be sensitive to different material parameters. These two molecules could then be used as complementary probes allowing an original and detailed study of the polymer and nanocomposites architecture. "

Differences found in their composition might have influenced their grinding ability, as observed with the difference of sizes, i.e. 109 μm, 148 μm and 46 μm, respectively. Thereafter, composites structure was characterized regarding their morphology, fibre / matrix interaction, matrix molecular weight and crystallization behaviour. Poor fibre / matrix adhesion, degradation of PHBV polymer chains, and decrease of PHBV’s crystallinity were evidence. Consequently, mechanical properties were degraded in presence of the fibres. Water vapour transfer rate of composites was increased with wheat straw fibres introduction while it was decreased for olive mills-based materials. Regarding the food packaging applications, PHBV / wheat straw fibres composites appeared as promising materials to reach the requirements of respiring food products, whereas PHBV / olive mills composites would be more adapted for water sensitive products.

743,Exploring the potentialities of using lignocellulosic fibres derived from three food by-products as constituents of biocomposites for food packaging.xml,['Introduction']," The basic right of people to the food they need is the greatest challenge facing the world community. Roughly one-third of the edible parts of food produced for human consumption is lost and / or wasted throughout the food supply chain, from initial agricultural production down to final household consumption (Gustavsson et al., 2011). In this context, one of the main challenges common to both the fields of materials and food is the development of innovative and sustainable packaging materials. This first means the development of economically competitive and efficient packaging able to reduce food losses and waste by improving shelf life for perishable foods, which is possible by judiciously selecting or designing food packaging. This means also the reduction of the overall environmental impact of the food / packaging system by taking into account the environmental impact of the packaging itself. Concretely, food packaging material properties, including mainly mechanical and gas transfer properties, have to be adapted as a function of the food product requirements to be able to guarantee its best preservation. In the particular case of respiring fresh food products, packaging gas permeability and perm-selectivity are critical parameters to be controlled when designing new packaging materials. For this category of food products, as their shelf life is short, there is no need for long-lasting packaging materials, making biodegradable materials interesting environmental-friendly solutions. Among the different biodegradable materials commercially available, poly(hydroxy-3-butyrate-co-3-valerate) (PHBV), is a bacterial polyester presenting the advantage of being bio-sourced and potentially prepared from food industry by-products (Serafim et al., 2008). Its main drawbacks are its high cost (3-5 € / kg, Chanprateep, 2010) and its barrier properties which are too high to fit respiring products needs (Shogren, 1997). One strategy to modulate PHBV barrier properties while maintaining the full biodegradability of the materials and reducing the final cost of materials is to mix it with low cost lignocellulosic fibres such as wood fibres (Reinsch and Kelley, 1997), spruce fibres, ground olive stone (Dufresne et al., 2003), flax fibres (Wong et al., 2004), jute and abaca fibres (Bledzki and Jaszkiewicz, 2010), wheat straw fibres (Avella et al., 2000, Ahankari et al., 2011) or beer spent grain fibres (Cunha et al., 2014). The cheapest and most environmentally virtuous lignocellulosic fibres are those obtained from food industry solid by-products. Their upcycling as fillers in biocomposites would also help waste reduction in food industry as well. In this context, the European project EcoBioCAP aimed at extending the state-of-the-art by developing a new range of food packaging constituents, i.e. low cost, largely available, biodegradable and functional fibres issued from the wheat, beer and oil industry solid by-products. Wheat straw is a by-product of the production of wheat grains, mainly composed of cell walls which are constituted of a lignocellulosic network. It is widely available around the world (e.g. in Europe: 80 million of tons / year, 25 € for 1000 kg with price volatility) and traditionally used for low-value purposes, mainly in cattle, livestock feeding or agricultural mulch, the rest being burnt or simply thrown away. The production of wheat straw fibres (WSF) with controlled size for food packaging applications can be easily performed by successive dry grinding processes, without any washing step, as reported by Silva et al. (2011). Spent grains are brewing by-products (BSG) resulting from wort production (Brányik et al., 2005) (around 8 millions of tons / year of dried BSG in Europe, at a cost almost nul). They are a cellulose-and lignin-rich fraction of the barley grains that is typically sold for cattle feed or disposed of in landfills. Brányik et al. (2001) devised a method to separate a lignin-rich fraction from the other spent grains components. This method has yields of ca. 10 wt% of lignin-rich material. Nowadays, in accordance with the new tendency to find solutions for food industry residues, brewing spent grains proved to be useful in applications such as human and animal nutrition, energy production, paper manufacture and absorbent material. Finally, olive pomace is the paste-like residue obtained from the olive oil production (800 kg / 1000 kg olives, 7 millions of tons / year in Europe), which is composed of skin, pulp, stone and olive kernel. Its insoluble fibre fraction was determined to be 65.3 wt% (representing hemicelluloses, cellulose and lignin) (Laufenberg, 2003). The high amounts of phenolic compounds as well as dietary fibre make olive pomace as a valuable source for further processing and fractionation (Cioffi et al., 2010). However, refinery processes are not widely developed as the use of the insoluble fibre fraction is still very limited. Such moist solid wastes of olive oil but also beer industry, are highly accessible to microbial spoilage and thus cannot be stored without further intensive drying which adds on the energy bill. Potential applications are animal feed (but not always suitable due to high content of secondary plant metabolites) (Brozzoli et al., 2010) or fertilizers but mostly the by-products are disposed without any creation of value. Recently, some studies were devoted to the use of BSG (Bledzki et al., 2010, Cunha et al., 2014), olive pomace fibres (Dufresne et al., 2003, Amar et al., 2010), or wheat straw fibres (Avella et al., 2000, Ahankari et al., 2011) as reinforcing agents in polymer matrices, thus opening promising outlets with added value to these food wastes. Hence, PHBV / lignocellulosic fibres food packaging materials should fulfil requirements for fresh food products, both regarding permeability needs and biodegradability. Unfortunately, too few materials of this kind were developed aiming the study of properties specific to food packaging materials application, especially permeability properties. Therefore, this study will bring more elements of knowledge answering this lack of information. The aim of the present work is to explore the potentialities of using lignocellulosic fibres derived from three different solid food by-products, i.e. wheat straw fibres, spent grains and olive pomace, as fillers in PHBV to develop biocomposites for food packaging applications. Special attention will be first given to better understand the impact of fibre origin on their grinding behaviour, resultant intrinsic characteristics and processability through melt extrusion. Then, the paper will focus on investigating the relationships between some of the main structural characteristics of the composite and its constituents, and the composites properties. Thoroughly, the studied fibres characteristics will be their composition, size and morphology, while the studied matrix characteristics will be the polymer chain length and the crystallinity. As regards the structural characteristics of the composites, the study will focus on the fibre dispersion state, assessed by microscopic observations. And finally, the studied composite properties will be the mechanical and barrier properties, which are directly related to a potential food packaging application. "

The extraction of phenolic compounds was performed under conditions optimized at Fraunhofer IVV. For this the olive pomace was suspended in an ethanol-water-solution (70:30 w / w). The solid to liquid ratio was 1:15 (w / w). For extraction the suspension was stirred at 80 °C. After a treatment time of 90 min, the fibres were recovered by filtration and dried. This extraction of phenolic compounds was applied to the fibre material in order to prevent colouring reactions due to oxidation of phenolic compounds. Furthermore the extract could improve the overall economics of the use of olive fibres as phenols are natural antioxidants of relevance for several industrial sectors (Bertin et al., 2011). Then, residual oil was removed by treating the olive pomace with n-hexane for 48 h in a Soxhlet extractor in order to avoid a negative impact on the material due to fat oxidation. For the chemical removal of the proteins from olive pomace, an acidic-caustic treatment was applied, as described by Brányik et al. (2001). This process was applied in order to avoid a possible negative impact of proteins on thermoforming of the novel packaging material due to the formation of interactions between polypeptide chains (Verbeek and van den Berg, 2010).

Differences in composition between the three types of fibres have to be interpreted keeping in mind that different analysis protocols were used. Furthermore, comparison with already published values will be delicate due to the high variability of naturally sourced fibres, including the large range of studied cultivars, and the fact that plants evolve during their growth throughout the year and from one year to another. For the three types of fibres, cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose are the three main constituents (Fig. 2). However, the respective ratio between those significantly differs, due to their botanical origin and to the treatments they were submitted to. The three main constituents of WSF were cellulose (32±0.8 wt% d.b.), hemicellulose (20.5±0.5 wt% d.b.) and lignin (17.4±0.3 wt% d.b.), which was consistent with already published values (Alemdar and Sain, 2008, Habib et al., 1995). Among the three studied fibres, WSF displayed the highest content of ashes (6.1±0.1% d.b.), which was close to values reported by Habib et al. (1995) (7.3±0.7% d.b.). WSF displayed also the highest content of proteins (3.8±0.7% d.b.), which is unsurprising, given that the other fibres proteins were removed by treatments, and also coherent with the results of Habib et al. (1995) (i.e. 4.1±0.6% d.b.). Extractives count for 9.5±2.2% d.b. of WSF composition and can be ascribed to soluble waxes and fats. 10.8±4.4% d.b. of the composition remained unanalysed (“rest” part on Fig. 2), which were attributed to loss of material during experiments, and insoluble waxes and / or fats. Brewing spent grains (BSG) displayed the lowest lignin content (16.2±0.5% d.b.) and the highest in cellulose (55.6±0.6% d.b.), with an almost nul content of ashes (0.8±0.1% d.b). Comparison with literature is difficult due to the large range of already published values. For example, values such as 39% of cellulose, 12% of hemicellulose (vs. 6.3±0.2% d.b. on Fig. 2) and 22% of lignin were reported by Bledzki et al. (2010) for barley husk as well; while for brewer’s spent grains, Kanauchi et al. (2001) and Mussatto and Roberto (2005) reported, respectively, cellulose content of 25% d.b. and 16.8% d.b., hemicellulose content of 21% d.b. and 28.4% d.b., lignin content of 11.9% d.b. and 27.8% d.b., ash content of 2.4% d.b. and 4.6% d.b., protein content of 24.0% d.b. and 15.2% d.b., and lipid content of 10.6% d.b (determined solely in the study of Kanauchi et al.). Although composition of BSG may vary with barley variety, time of harvest, characteristics of hops and other adjuncts added during the brewing process, changes may also occur due to brewery technology, even within the same beer industry. The caustic treatment almost completely removed fat and protein residues from BSG, as shown by the low levels reported here, respectively, 1.2±0.1% d.b and 0.7±0.1% d.b (Fig. 2). Therefore, the remaining material was nearly a pure lignocellulosic substance. The rest of the composition (19±1.6% d.b.) might be ascribed to residual starch (reported to constitute 11% of Bledzki’s barley husk (Bledzki et al., 2010)). The composition of olive mills (OM) was characterized by the highest lignin content, which represented almost half of the dry matter (49% d.b.), before cellulose (38% d.b.) and hemicellulose (10% d.b.). The other components, initially present in olive pomace, were removed by different successive treatments, as described in Section 2.2.1. Fibre composition could be put in relation to its intrinsic mechanical properties (Young’s modulus and tensile strength), which are critical parameters governing the reinforcing effect of lignocellulosic fibres in polymer matrices (Faruk et al., 2012). For example, fibre tensile strength evolves exponentially with cellulose and inversely exponentially with lignin content, whereas no clear relationship is evidenced between Young’s Modulus and composition. Fibre composition could also constitute a first level of approach to understand the grindability of the lignocellulosic biomass. For example, the high ashes content of wheat straw should confer fragility, in favour of its grindability (Silva et al., 2011). On the other side, the high content in cellulose and hemicellulose reported for wheat straw and brewing spent grains may hinder the obtaining of fine powders (Silva et al., 2011). Confirming that, studies showed that the degradation of hemicelluloses and depolymerisation of cellulose, both occurring during the torrefaction of the lignocellulosic biomass, resulted in a more brittle solid product that can be ground down to a small particle size without excessive energy consumption (Arias et al., 2008, Bridgeman et al., 2010, Shang et al., 2012). We can thus suppose that olive mills, which display the highest lignin content, will be more prone to produce fine powders. "

766,Exploring the potentialities of using lignocellulosic fibres derived from three food by-products as constituents of biocomposites for food packaging.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Fibres characteristics', 'Fibre size and grinding energy consumption']"," Despite the same grinding process was used for the final fibre size reduction step, WSF, BSG and OM achieved different particle sizes (Fig. 3), respectively, 109 μm, 148 μm and 46 μm of median equivalent diameter (in% of volume occupied by particles). These measurements were made assuming particles have a spherical shape. Hence, in the case of high aspect ratio, laser scattering measured size did neither reflect actual particle length nor width. In all the cases, particle size distributions were characterized by a high size polydispersity (Fig. 3), stemming from the complex heterogeneous structure of the lignocellulosic biomass. Several populations could thus be seen within each particle distribution. BSG seemed to be constituted of three fractions with respective median size of 400 μm, 100 μm (the most important), and 10 μm. OM, on its side, displayed at least two fractions: a minor one, centred on 300 μm, and a major one, around 40 μm. The repartition of these different fractions was ascribed to differences of tissues grindability within the complex lignocellulosic structures that are the studied fibres. Differences in grinding energy consumption were also noticed. Grinding of WSF required least energy (441 kWh t^-1), whereas BSG and OM grinding required similar energy (respectively, 687 kWh t^-1 and 631 kWh t^-1). More interestingly, energy consumption can also be expressed as a function of the final particle surface-calculated as spheres, with the apparent diameter measured with laser scattering analysis-which enables to compare the efficiency of grinding regarding the reached size, as proposed by Barakat et al. (2014). This calculation allowed to highlight that OM was in fact the less energy consuming (3.2.10^-3 kWh g^-1 m^-2) to reach the same particles’ surface than WSF (5.2.10^-3 kWh g^-1 m^-2) and BSG (1.1.10^-2 kWh g^-1 m^-2). It is worth noting that grinding energy consumption was measured on lab-scale equipments and may vary during up-scaling. Nevertheless, based on the work of Luz et al. (2010) who analysed the life cycle of a PP-bagasse composite, we can suppose that the energy required for grinding the fibres will represent a very little part in the life cycle of a composite, i.e. around 1% of the overall energy (which includes cultivation of fibres’source, transportation of all materials, composite preparation and PP production). Final particle size and energy consumption have been reported to strongly depend on the mechanical behaviour of fibres. For example, it was observed that high moisture content hindered fibres grinding due to the softening of the fibres (Mani et al., 2004). On the contrary, grinding was eased in cryogenic conditions (Hemery et al., 2010), i.e. smaller particle sizes were reached, because fibre constituents were then at the glassy state and therefore, more rigid. In the present study, since the three types of fibres were dried in the same conditions before grinding experiments that occurred at room temperature, differences of grindability may be ascribed to differences in fibre softness and fragility. As already mentioned, the composition, which was evaluated at the molecular scale, could be a first approach to understand differences in fibre grindability. But it should be kept in mind that the key parameter may be the supramolecular structure of constituents at the histological level. It can be thus supposed that BSG achieved highest particle size and grinding energy consumption because it might be the softest fibre among those studied, whereas OM achieved the smallest size because it was the most rigid and / or the most fragile. It has to be noted that OM still contained kernels, which are more rigid than olive flesh alone. A preliminary study (results not published) showed that the grinding of OM without kernels was impossible in the conditions used in this study, as olive fibres clogged the impact mill sieve. As in olive processing industry the olives will in most cases be processed together with their kernels, these results seem to be encouraging for a potential use of OM for composite applications. "

This means that other parameters, such as surface state and energy, are then governing composite’s properties (Herrera-Franco and Valadez-González, 2005). However, the three types of fibres displayed different morphologies. WSF are mainly composed of rectangular particles that have visually a fibrous structure, with an aspect ratio around 3-5, which would classify WSF as poorly elongated fibres. BSG also display a fibrous structure, but its twisted appearance makes the estimation of their aspect ratio difficult. Since fibres are thinner and longer than WSF, BSG will be considered slightly more elongated. The aspect of BSG fibres in Fig. 4 suggests softness, which was also inferred from grindability results. In the case of OM, it is difficult to talk of fibres, as the particles observed are not elongated at all. OM have an undefined shape, close to sphere-like or semolina particles. "

770,Exploring the potentialities of using lignocellulosic fibres derived from three food by-products as constituents of biocomposites for food packaging.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Composites processability and resulting structure', 'Processability']"," During the melt-mixing step with PHBV, the processability of each composite was assessed towards increasing fibre content by visual observations of the appearance of the extrudates upon dripping out of die. An “easy processability” relies to extrusion stability and extrudate displaying a smooth surface. A “limited processability” is defined by extrusion instability (not continuous extrudate), which can be overcome by adjusting extrusion parameters, and few surface defects. Difficult processability is characterized by irredeemable extrusion instability, and gross melt fracture defects, with breakings of the extrudates due to materials friability. Finally, as defined by Dufresne et al. (2003), a highest possible filling level (HPFL) corresponded to the critical filler content beyond which the compounds were friable and discontinuous with no physical integrity (just crumbled at the die). First is to be noticed that the preparation of materials from PHBV and BSG was not possible, because of fibres aggregation before entering the extruder, causing clogging and preventing any controlled feeding of the fibres inside the mix. Therefore, no BSG-filled material was obtained. To overcome such a feeding difficulty, it would be possible to “wet” the fibres by using a third component, such as polyethylene glycol. Another solution should be to use force-feeding equipment. However, these solutions were not applied here, as we wanted to compare systems based on the same formulation-only two constituents, i.e. a polymer matrix and untreated fibres-and obtained through the same processing route (i.e. no pre-mix produced to feed the extruder, no use of powder form for the PHBV, etc.). WSF-and OM-filled materials displayed the same processability, which was progressively hindered for increasing fibre content, both reaching a HPFL value of 50 wt% (Table 1). Composites processability depends on competitive phenomena. Introducing fibres with increasing content and / or size might:-Increase viscosity due to the reinforcing effect of solid fillers in the viscoelastic matrix, up to the percolation threshold where a viscoelastic solid is reached, which cannot be extruded anymore (Cunha et al., 2014).-Decrease viscosity due to the degradation (thermal) of the matrix (Amar et al., 2010), or due to a lubricating effect of fillers (local increase of shear rate near the fibre surface) coupled to the shear thinning behaviour of the matrix. Increase viscosity due to the reinforcing effect of solid fillers in the viscoelastic matrix, up to the percolation threshold where a viscoelastic solid is reached, which cannot be extruded anymore (Cunha et al., 2014). Decrease viscosity due to the degradation (thermal) of the matrix (Amar et al., 2010), or due to a lubricating effect of fillers (local increase of shear rate near the fibre surface) coupled to the shear thinning behaviour of the matrix. Despite OM is smaller than WSF, thus, should be less of an obstacle for PHBV chains, and should reach packing at a higher fibre content, their size seem to be not different enough to significantly affect the melt mix. Therefore, 50 wt% was the HPFL for both fibres, probably because of percolating fibres within the matrix as demonstrated elsewhere for similar composites (Cunha et al., 2014). Best results, i.e. defect-free extrudates with still some strength and ability to pelletization, is obtained for 20 wt% maximum filling as indicated in Table 1, therefore for the rest of the study, a fibre content of 20 wt% was selected to prepare composite films, as it is the maximum ratio easily processable by extrusion.

PHBV matrix alone displayed a smooth surface, with the presence of micro-crystals-circled on Fig. 5C-which were ascribed to the presence of boron nitride as nucleating agent in this grade of PHBV. Low magnification pictures of composites displayed a general view of PHBV-20WSF and PHBV-20OM films (Fig. 5D and G). For both samples, fibres were easily identifiable, and even more in the case of PHBV-WSF since PHBV does not cover their surface (Fig. 5D). Fibres were homogeneously distributed within the polymer matrix, with no evidence of fibre aggregates, even at a higher magnification. PHBV-20OM’s surface (Fig. 5G) seems to be smoother than PHBV-20WSF’s, probably due to the fact that OM are smaller than WSF, the defects being thus simply smaller. PHBV-20WSF pictures present some fibre pull-outs and debonding holes, which are to be related with a poor adhesion at the fibre / matrix interface. Zooming on the fibres themselves, OM appeared quite well included within the PHBV matrix, whereas WSF were easier to spot (Fig. 5E and H). Fibre / matrix interface, well observed on Fig 5F and I, was characterized by a smaller interfacial gap between OM fibres and PHBV, while matrix adhesion on WSF seems to be partial. Poor fibre / matrix adhesion could be due to residual water content in WSF (4 wt% w.b.) at the time of material processing. "

PHBV’s main degradation reaction is an intramolecular cis-elimination which provokes random chain scission, leading to a drastic reduction of the polymer molecular weight and the formation of a new acid end (Kopinke and Mackenzie, 1997, Leroy et al., 2012). From the initial PHBV molecular weight of 423,820 g mol^-1 with an Ip of 2.47, the processed neat matrix (after extrusion and hot-pressing steps) had a molecular weight diminished down to 219,340 g mol^-1 with an Ip of 2.14. The degradation of PHBV polymer chains occuring during thermomechanical processes was recently reported by Leroy et al. (2012) during the injection moulding of a similar PHBV. These authors also identified the formation of oligomers (of the order 10^4 g / mol) for residence times larger than 25 s at 175 °C. Introduction of fibres at a ratio of 20 wt% led to an even more decrease in the PHBV’s molecular weight, i.e. down to about 170,000 g mol^-1 for both WSF-and OM-filled materials. Indeed, hydrolysis of PHBV chains have been proven to be catalysed by the presence of water, alcohols and / or acids (Spitalsky et al., 2006 and Kawalec et al., 2008), which can be produced during biomass thermal degradation. Despite differences in molecular composition, both lignocellulosic fibres had the same effect on PHBV chains degradation. Degradation of PHBV chains, thus decrease of matrix viscosity might explain why fibres content as high as 50 wt% could be reached during processability tests. "

Melting, crystallization and glass transition temperatures of the neat matrix and composites filled with 20 wt% of either WSF or OM are reported in Table 2. The melting temperature (Tm1) of PHBV was slightly but significantly decreased in the presence of either WSF or OM, which might be ascribed to the previously reported decrease in polymer molecular weight. For WSF-based composites, two melting peaks (Tm1 and Tm2) are displayed on Fig. 6 which would reflect an interaction of wheat straw fibres with PHBV, affecting the crystal type. Same comment can be stated, based on crystallization temperature value (Table 2), as addition of fibres hinders the PHBV crystallization (as reflected by lower Tc). The decrease of PHBV crystallization temperature was far less affected in the case of OM-filled composites. Theses lowered values of Tc implies that crystallisation was slowed down by fibre introduction. Hypothesis explaining the difference between both fibres might be that WSF hindered more PHBV chain mobility. As regards crystallinity determined by DSC (Table 2), it seems not to be affected by WSF introduction, as reported for other lignocellulosic fibres (Nyambo et al., 2011, Ludueña et al., 2012), whereas it slightly decreased for OM-based composites. In both cases, the little effect of fibres on cristallinity could be explained by the large amount of boron nitride (0.5 wt% ) used as nucleating agents in the matrix. Regarding glass transition temperature (Tg), a plasticising effect of WSF seems to occur, as Tg is decreased down to-3.8 °C. Another plasticising cause might be linked to the presence of PHBV oligomers induced by the thermal degradation of the polymer. Under polarized optical microscope (Fig. 7), OM and WSF were quite easily identifiable, especially in the molten state (Fig. 7A and C) as some of their components appeared to be birefringent, cellulose crystals in all likelihood. In the crystallised state (Fig. 7B and D) PHBV spherulites are too small to be measured at the chosen magnification. PHBV’s spherulites size has been reported to reach 40-50 μm (Chan et al., 2004, Fei et al., 2006), but in the PHBV grade used in this study, the presence of boron nitride as nucleating agents generates several nucleation sites, hence leading to much smaller spherulites. During cooling, first crystals began to appear around 120 °C within the bulk polymer matrix of PHBV-WSF, and crystallization spread itself visibly until around 112 °C, then “cracks” began to appear, as revealed by the presence of black lines on the pictures at the crystallized state (Fig. 7B). The nature of these “cracks” is not established yet, and it is worth noting that no crack was visible on SEM pictures. Two very important observations were outdrawn from this experiment. Firstly, crystallization did not occur preferentially around the fibres, which confirmed DSC results about the absence of nucleating effect of WSF. Subsequently, the “cracks” in the matrix did not appear preferentially around the fibres. To our knowledge, this last phenomenon was not reported in literature, and might be another cause of mechanical failure for PHBV-based materials, if those cracks are voids formed during cooling step of films preparation and not specific to POM sample preparation. Since no void seems to appear at the matrix / fibre interface, POM might confirm matrix / fibre partial adhesion. If the cracks are indeed voids, it would indicate that the polymer would “prefer” to break itself, rather than to be separated from the fibres. As for WSF-filled materials, the crystallization of PHBV-20OM composites occurred around 120 °C, with the appearance of “cracks” around 113 °C. But these “cracks” were much smaller than and not as visible as in PHBV-20WSF, probably thanks to the improved dispersion of OM within the composite. POM observations were in opposition to what was observed on SEM images, on which fibre / PHBV debonding was observed. Bias of each experiment has to be taken in account in our interpretation: for cryo-fracture of PHBV, the material is violently cooled, which might generate the gap observed between fibres and matrix, due to differences of thermal shrinkage between both components. At the opposite, POM samples are between two glass slides, which constraint the material to crystallize with a limited mobility, maybe favouring the cracks as well. It is to be notice that protocol used for POM echoes preparation of PHBV-based films: after compression moulding, cooling of samples has to occur under a weight, otherwise films are deformed by warps and no further testing is possible on those (tensile tests and gas transfer measurements). Therefore, POM might display what really happens in samples used for functional properties assessment. Both previous crystallization analyses have the drawback of reheating the sample for crystallization study. WAXD (Fig. 8) enables to study directly the samples, without reheating step. Essentially, spectra resemble those of films obtained with the film blowing of the same PHBV compounded with BSG submitted to a different milling process (Cunha et al., 2014). The addition of fibres significantly reduces the intensities of the peaks located at 27 ° and 13.7 ° which are assigned to the reflections of the (0 4 0) and (0 2 0) planes of PHB crystals, respectively. This indicates that the crystallinity of the PHBV matrix is affected by the fibres. The films crystallinities computed from the WAXD spectra are reported in Table 2: neat PHBV film show a crystallinity which is consistent with the crystallinity computed from DSC data. In contrast, WAXD-determined crystallinities of the composite films show significantly lower crystallinities than DSC-determined ones. Similar results were found in blown films of PHBV compounded with BSG (Cunha et al., 2014) and were ascribed to the poor interface between fibres and PHBV. However in this study, the half widths of peaks at 13.7 ° were not affected by the addition of fibres, in contrast to the changes found here: the size of crystals is increased from 1.03 to 1.18 nm in the presence of WSF, whereas smaller crystals are found (0.96 nm) when OM is added. The thicker lamellae found for WSF composite are in harmony with the second melting process occurring 2 °C above the melting point of PHBV alone (at Tm2). As alternatively, two types of lamellae were formed due to the presence of WSF, WAXD spectra are consequentially changed in terms of peak intensity and half width. To sum up all results obtained on crystallinity and crystallization of PHBV-based samples from the different analyses performed: PHBV’s crystallization was hindered in presence of fibres and reached lower crystallinities, as evidenced by DSC, but mostly by WAXD. Crystalline structure was also affected by the presence of fibres, as spherulites and lamellae were thicker in presence of WSF. Fibres did not display nucleating effect. In addition to crystallization information, analyses gave evidence of a plasticizing effect induced by the presence of WSF, and cracks were evidenced by POM analysis for composite samples. "

780,Exploring the potentialities of using lignocellulosic fibres derived from three food by-products as constituents of biocomposites for food packaging.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Composite functional properties', 'Thermal stability']"," As already described by molecular weight measurements, PHBV thermal sensitivity is well known, and resulting materials thermal stability should be assessed in order to predict their applicability in industry. Regarding its weight loss evolution towards temperature, it consists in one sharply drop, as already reported (Singh and Mohanty, 2007), around 283 °C (Fig. 9). Olive mills and wheat straw fibres exhibited the same behaviour: one main weight loss, ascribed to hemicellulose and cellulose degradation (Chen and Kuo, 2010), around 342 °C and 315 °C, respectively, while lignin degradation finishes during a second weight loss (Chen and Kuo, 2010), around 450 °C. OM and WSF thermal degradations leave 23 and 21% of residue. Both fibres can resist extrusion temperatures (160-180 °C). Nevertheless, WSF curve display a first weight loss around 100 °C, which can be ascribed to residual water. These results are consistent with thermal degradation behaviour observed for other lignocellulosic fibres (Chen and Kuo, 2010). PHBV-20OM and PHBV-20WSF have a thermal behaviour similar to their main constituent, i.e. PHBV, with one major weight loss around 257 °C and 254 °C, respectively. This reduction of thermal degradation temperature was also observed by Singh and Mohanty (2007), and could be associated to a degradation of PHBV’s polymer chains within composites, confirmed by the GPC measurements. The last weight loss of composites might be ascribed to fibres components, degrading at higher temperature. Fortunately, the degradation temperatures remained above the processing temperature (180 °C) for all the formulations. This goes in the same direction than what was suggested by GPC and DSC results: thermal stability of PHBV is affected by the sole presence of fibres, independantly from their type. Since the composition of WSF and OM are also quite different, we can also add that composition (in the range tested) also has no impact on thermal stability. For the record, composition differences between WSF and OM are mainly about hemicellulose (respectively, 21 wt% and 11 wt% ) and lignin (respectively, 17 wt% and 49 wt% ) ratios. "

782,Exploring the potentialities of using lignocellulosic fibres derived from three food by-products as constituents of biocomposites for food packaging.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Composite functional properties', 'Mechanical properties']"," As previously observed on similar materials (Dufresne et al., 2003), PHBV-based composites had the classical behaviour of a rigid and fragile thermoplastic (Fig. 10), with a Young’s modulus of 2.8±0.3 GPa, a stress at break of 36.4±2.7 MPa and an elongation at break of 1.8±0.3% (Table 3). The introduction of fibres led to a strong degradation of both PHBV’s stress and strain at break, which can be partially ascribed to the decrease of PHBV Mw previously observed. Such mechanical properties evolution is commonly noticed in all studies dealing with biocomposites (Avella et al., 2000, Dufresne et al., 2003, Baiardo et al., 2004, Singh and Mohanty, 2007, Ahankari et al., 2011, Ludueña et al., 2012). However, most of these studies report an increase of Young’s modulus, whereas it was not significantly modified for PHBV-20OM and PHBV-20WSF, all materials of this study having about the same rigidity. Evolution of composites Young’s modulus is related to rigidity of each constituent and the quality of the interface to transmit the load. In every cited case, neat polymer matrix displayed a Young’s modulus value in the range of 40-560 MPa, whereas the fibre Young’s modulus is usually comprised between 5 and 50 GPa according to the type of fibres (botanic origin, morphology and surface treatment). Therefore, combination of materials with such a difference of rigidity leads to a reinforcement much more apparent than in the present study, where PHBV, WSF and OM have Young’s modulus values within the same order of magnitude, i.e. 2.8 GPa, 1.6 GPa (Montaño-Leyva et al., 2013) and 10 GPa (Dufresne et al., 2003), respectively. Nevertheless, stress and strain at break are affected differently by both fibres, with properties less affected in the case of OM-filled composites. It has been demonstrated that stress and strain at break depends on polymer chain length and crystallinity and fibres size, aspect ratio and fibre / matrix adhesion (Pukánszky, 1990, Ludueña et al., 2012). We can also suspect that formation of “cracks” in the matrix, as observed on POM pictures might affect mechanical properties. Better preservation of PHBV-20OM properties might then be explained by smaller fibre size, slightly better fibre / matrix adhesion (suggested by SEM), diminution of PHBV crystallinity and smaller defects induced by the fibres.

In the case of food packaging, the wide variety of food products to be packaged requires, in particular, a wide range of mass transfer properties (Petersen et al., 1999). Among them, water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) is a key feature for food preservation. Indeed, a high WVTR value can be required for respiring fresh products such as cheese, fruits and vegetable because of their transpiration, whereas a low WVTR value would be required for water sensitive dry products such as sandwiches (Petersen et al., 1999). For example, a packaging material displaying a WVTR as low as possible or 162 g m^-2 day^-1 would be required to properly conserve and limit food degradation reactions of sandwiches and strawberries (Sousa-Gallagher et al., 2013), respectively. WVTR and WVP valued of neat PHBV films and films filled with 20 wt% of either WSF or OM are given in Table 4. WVTR of the neat PHBV matrix was found to be 9.9±2.5 g m^-2 day^-1, which was consistent with the value found for another grade of PHBV containing 6% of valerate content using the same conditions of analysis (Shogren, 1997). The incorporation of lignocellulosic fibres (at a filler content of 20 wt% ) on WVTR of PHBV had not the same impact according to the nature of the fibre. The introduction of wheat straw fibres to PHBV led to a significant increase in WVTR up to 32.2±2.6 g m^-2 day^-1, whereas the introduction of olive mills led to a decrease in WVTR down to 3.9±1.5 g m^-2 day^-1. Regarding the food packaging applications, it can be thus concluded that PHBV / wheat straw fibres composites appeared as promising materials to reach the requirements of respiring food products, whereas PHBV / olive mills composites would be more adapted for water sensitive products. The increase in WVTR for WSF-filled materials could be related to the hydrophilicity of wheat straw fibres that adsorbed much more water vapour than PHBV, as highlighted by water vapour sorption kinetics (Wolf, 2014), and most probably, to structural changes at either the macroscopic or (macro) molecular scale induced by the presence of wheat straw fibres. At the macroscopic scale, a preferential pathway for the diffusion of water vapour was supposed to be created both at the fibre / matrix interface, as supported by the poor fibre / matrix adhesion, but also in the bulk matrix, due to the presence of micro-cracks and microscopic holes. At the molecular level, the degradation of the polymer induced by the presence of fibres, revealed by TGA and GPC measurements, as well as the plasticizing effect of WSF, revealed by DSC analysis, could also be in favour of the increase in WVTR. The reduction of WVTR for OM-filled materials could be related to the small size of particles, thus limiting the risk of creating a percolating pathway. In addition, OM containing higher lignin content than WSF might lead to a more hydrophobic character. Therefore, the OM particles are more likely to have acted as obstacles, increasing the tortuosity of water vapour pathway through PHBV-20OM composite. "

WSF, BSG and OM displayed contrasted compositions, BSG being the more cellulose-rich fibres whereas OM contained more lignin, leading to different grinding ability and energy consumption. Mechanical properties of PHBV-based composites were negatively affected by the presence of fibres, mainly due to PHBV polymer chain degradation, a decrease of PHBV’s crystallinity, a poor adhesion at the fibre / matrix adhesion and the formation of cracks during composites cooling. Such phenomena were all the more pronounced in the case of wheat straw fibres. As regards water vapour permeability, the impact of fibres was not the same since a 3.5-fold increase was noticed in the case of wheat straw fibres against a 2.5-fold decrease in the case of olive mills. Regarding the food packaging applications, it can be thus concluded that PHBV / wheat straw fibres composites appeared as promising materials to reach the requirements of respiring food products, whereas PHBV / olive mills composites would be more adapted for water sensitive products. Further studies assessing such composite biodegradability should force the issue of designing a new generation of eco-efficient packaging. "

Transmission electron microscopy observations showed that MMT nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed within the matrix but not completely exfoliated. Contact angles, water uptake and water vapour sorption measurements showed that the presence of MMT led to a significant reduction of the water sensitivity of WG-based materials. This effect was attributed to a different structuring of protein network in the presence of MMT. Significant changes in the permeability of films towards water vapour and aroma compounds were observed for MMT contents higher than 5 wt% , while O2 and CO2 permeabilities remained unchanged. Finally, a slight improvement in tensile properties was obtained for filler contents higher than 2.5 wt% . "

802,Functional properties of wheat gluten montmorillonite nanocomposite films processed by casting.xml,['Introduction']," For many years, environmental legislation as well as consumer demand have resulted in the development of “green polymeric materials” that would involve the use of natural substances and that could be biodegradable. In this context, many studies have been devoted to the use of proteins, notably wheat gluten (WG), for packaging applications [1], [2]. Wheat gluten is an attractive agropolymer because of its high availability and its good film-forming properties [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Besides the biodegradability of wheat gluten films [7], such materials exhibit effective barrier properties against lipids, gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide [8], and aroma compounds [9]. The main drawback is their high water sensitivity. Their mechanical properties and barrier properties are strongly affected by the presence of water acting as a plasticizer [3]. From a biochemical point of view, gluten is a mixture of two main proteins, i.e. glutenin and gliadin. Glutenins consists in polypeptides linked together with disulphide bonds, thus forming a macropolymer (MW ranging from 150,000 to 2,000,000). Gliadins are monomeric proteins formed by a single polypeptide chain (MW ranging from 15,000 to 150,000). The gluten system is considered as a polymer network that is stabilized by various interactions, such as covalent bonds, non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic or ionic interactions) and entanglements. Gluten, as heteropolymer, offers numerous opportunities for interactions, crosslinking reactions or chemical graftings. A first alternative to control barrier and mechanical properties of WG-based films is to modify the polymer network through the formation of intramolecular and intermolecular covalent crosslinks, for example by applying thermal treatments [4], [10] or by adding chemical crosslinkers [4]. Another approach is to mix wheat gluten with hydrophobic biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone [11] or polyester [12], or lipids [13], [14]. A third strategy is to incorporate fillers. In the last few years, many studies have been devoted to hybrid organic-inorganic systems and, in particular, to those in which layered silicates are dispersed at a nanometric scale in a polymeric matrix [15]. Layered silicates display a perfect crystalline structure consisting in two-dimensional layers where a central octahedral sheet of alumina or magnesia is linked with two external silica tetrahedrons [16]. The layer thickness is around 1 nm and the lateral dimensions of these layers vary from 30 nm to several micrometers [16]. Montmorillonite is one of the most commonly used layered silicates and is characterized by a moderate negative surface charge. Layered silicates are known to improve many properties of polymers in which they are dispersed. Among these properties, an increase in tensile modulus at filler contents as low as 1 wt% , a higher thermal stability, and better barrier properties have been largely demonstrated [16]. The limiting aspect of the use of such nanofillers is the difficulty to correctly disperse them in a polymeric matrix due to their preferred face-to-face stacking in agglomerated tactoïds. Recently, montmorillonite has been added to WG in order to reduce the aging rate of WG films [17]. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the introduction of MMT on some functional properties of WG-based films. Nanocomposite films consisting in WG plasticized with glycerol and reinforced with unmodified MMT were processed by casting. Morphology and microstructure of this multi-phase system was discussed in relation with wettability, water uptake, thermal stability, tensile properties and barrier properties towards water vapour, oxygen, carbon dioxide and aroma compounds.

The aroma compounds flow rate (mg s^-1) was determined by comparing the aroma compound peak surface when using the film with that obtained without film and by using the perfect gas law. The permeability of the film towards aroma compounds was deduced from the flow rate at steady state and calculated from Eq. (5), where J is the flow rate, x the thickness, A the film exposed surface and ΔP is the gradient of vapour pressure across the film. The diffusivity was then calculated from the transient state from t0.5 using the following equation:(6)D=l27.2×t0.5 The sorption coefficients of aroma compounds (expressed in g of aroma compound by volume of material) were determined by extraction of the film at the permeation steady state. Films were firstly extracted with 5 mL of distilled water for 30 min under stirring. Then, 5 mL of dichloromethane and 100 μL of internal standard (25 g L^-1 2-heptanol in ethanol) were added and the whole solution was stirred for 16 h at 5.33 Hz (320 rpm). The organic phase was then recovered, dried on ammonium sulphate and analyzed by GC. Extraction yield was previously determined for each film by placing a known amount of aroma compound onto the film. Sample was injected (split mode 1 / 20) into Varian 3800 GC (Varian) equipped with a capillary column (CPsil 15 m, 0.32 mm, 0.25 μm). Temperature of the injector was 250 °C. Hydrogen (2 mL min^-1) was used as the carrier gas and the oven temperature was programmed from 50 to 250 °C at a rate of 4 °C min^-1. FID (air 300 mL min^-1, hydrogen 30 mL min^-1) was used at 300 °C. "

816,Functional properties of wheat gluten montmorillonite nanocomposite films processed by casting.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Rheological and morphological properties']"," Rheological properties of WG and WG / MMT solutions (1-10 wt% of clay) are presented in Table 1. WG proteins are insoluble in water because of their low content of ionized polar amino acids (14% ), many hydrophobic interactions between non-polar amino acids (39.6% ) and the presence of inter and intra-molecular disulfide bonds stabilizing high molecular weight protein fractions. Thus, acidic conditions (pH 4) and the use of sodium sulphite (0.2% , w / w, WG) to reduce disulphide bonds [18], [19] were required for dispersing WG in water. The presence of MMT led to an increase in the consistency and a constant decrease in the flow behaviour index (Table 1). This phenomenon was more pronounced for increasing filler content. This shear-thinning behaviour (i.e. pseudoplastic) was characterized by a reduction in the viscosity at high shear rates. As shown in Fig. 2, at high shear rates, WG / MMT film-forming solutions exhibited stronger shear thinning than pure WG solutions. Such an increase in shear viscosity at low shear rate (Fig. 2) due to the introduction of clays was previously reported by Giannelis [20], Krishnamoorti et al. [21] and Manias et al. [22] in synthetic polymer solutions. This behaviour was attributed to (i) changes in preferential orientation of layered silicates and polymer conformation, parallel to the flow direction, during shearing and to (ii) interactions between MMT and WG proteins that may establish. For high MMT contents, the high viscosity of the film-forming solutions rendered difficult their mixing and spreading, leading to the presence of residual bubbles in the films, particularly for WG-10. A key property of nanocomposite materials is the good dispersion of nanofillers in the matrix. To evaluate dispersion and distribution of layered silicates within the WG matrix TEM observations were realized (Fig. 3). Filled materials (WG-1 to WG-10) clearly showed a particular microstructure: layered silicates appeared as dark lines about 200 nm long. Layered silicates were homogeneously distributed within the matrix whatever the filler content. However, the presence of stacking layered silicates indicated that MMT nanoclays were not completely exfoliated. For filler contents higher than 5 wt% , layered silicates seemed to form a connected network. "

820,Functional properties of wheat gluten montmorillonite nanocomposite films processed by casting.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Water sensitivity']"," Water sensitivity of WG-based materials is an important challenge for the substitution of traditional plastics, especially for packaging applications. The poor resistance of WG films to water is due to the hydrophilic nature of the protein (presence of polar peptides) and to the substantial amount of hydrophilic plasticizer (glycerol) added to impart adequate film flexibility. Water sensitivity was evaluated by four experiments: initial contact angles measurements, absorption rate of a water drop deposited on the surface of the films, water vapour sorption measurements and water uptake experiments (by immersion of the films in liquid water). Initial contact angles of a water drop and water absorption rates values are given in Table 2 (for films stored at 25 °C and 58% RH). WG films exhibited the highest initial contact angle (76 °). This value, located between those of polyethylene (105.1 °) and cellulose acetate (54.3 °) [23], revealed the nature both hydrophilic (due to polar amino acids) and hydrophobic (due to non-polar amino acids) of gluten proteins. Initial contact angle values decreased from 76 ° to 55 ° as MMT content increased from 0 to 10 wt% . Contrarily to the general tendency [24], the decrease in contact angle was observed in parallel with a decrease in water absorption rates. The presence of increasing amounts of MMT tended to favour the spreading of the water drop over the film surface and to limit the penetration of the drop within the film, resulting in a reduction of both surface hydrophibicity and absorption rates (Table 2). These results indicated that static and dynamic wetting properties were not necessarily related, as recently notified by Karbowiak et al. [25]. The evolution of the liquid water uptake versus time for WG-based films is displayed in Fig. 4. The behaviour of the neat matrix was completely different from those of the filled materials. Pure WG film partially disintegrated in water, preventing its correct weighing after only 30 s of immersion. It was assumed that the important swelling of WG film led to a rapid dispersion of protein chains. In the case of filled materials, the measurement of water uptake was possible whatever the filler content and even after one day of immersion. It is worth noting that only 1 wt% of MMT allowed preventing film disruption in water. Furthermore, the swelling capacity of the materials decreased as increasing filler contents (Fig. 4). The water uptake kinetics of filled materials can be divided into two zones. The first zone, corresponding to t ≤ 5 min was characterized by fast absorption rates. In the second zone, corresponding to longer times of immersion (t ≥ 10 min), the water uptake increased more slightly up to reach a value corresponding to the water uptake at equilibrium. For WG-1, a decrease in WU was observed after 10 min of immersion which was attributed to a loss in glycerol and soluble proteins that has been already observed for WG films [26]. Finally, we observed that WG-7.5 and WG-10 had about the same swelling behaviour. Liquid water uptakes at equilibrium (WUeq) of WG-based films which were measured after 30 min of immersion are reported in Table 3. It was verified that all filled samples reached equilibrium after 30 min of immersion. Indeed, after 4 h of immersion, no significant additional water uptake was observed. WUeq decreased continuously with MMT loading, leading to conclude that MMT particles allow reducing the swelling capability of the matrix. The water uptake of nanocomposite films decreased while nanoclays had a higher water retention capacity than pure WG films (nanoclays are known to absorb water about 30 times their weight [27]). The reduction in water uptake was already observed for epoxy / MMT [28] and thermoplastic starch / MMT [29] systems. The fact that the water uptake of WG-10 was about the same as WG-7.5 may be explained by a worse dispersion of MMT in the matrix in the case of high filler contents, as already observed for polyurethane / MMT nanocomposites [30]. Complete exfoliation of layered silicates may get more and more hindered because of geometrical constraints within the limited available space in the wheat gluten matrix. This difficulty of dispersion can also be attributed to the increase in viscosity observed when increasing filler contents (Table 1). Water vapour uptake results are given in Table 3. No correct value was obtained for WG-0 because films were very sticky. The sorption of water vapour decreased slightly when increasing the filler content. The reduction in water sensitivity when increasing the filler content can be explained by a tortuous pathway limiting water molecules penetration in the nanocomposites due to the high aspect ratio of the layered silicates if they are correctly dispersed and / or exfoliated in the matrix. The second hypothesis involved to explain the reduction in water sensitivity is a different surface and volume structuring of the protein network in the presence of MMT due to the establishment of specific interactions between MMT, WG and glycerol.

824,Functional properties of wheat gluten montmorillonite nanocomposite films processed by casting.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Barrier properties']"," The effect of nanoclays on barrier properties of WG films were investigated for gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, water vapour (Fig. 5), and aroma compounds (Table 4). Two aroma compounds of the same chemical serie (methyl ketones) but having different molecular weights and chain lengths have been chosen for this study: 2-heptanone (a C7 methyl ketone) and 2-nonanone (a C9 methyl ketone). The addition of MMT into WG had no effect on the permeability of the films towards gases (O2 and CO2) over the range of studied MMT contents (up to 10 wt% ). A slight decrease in water vapour permeability (WVP) was obtained for MMT contents ≥5 wt% (reduction of a factor 2) but no further change of WVP was observed for higher clay contents. Barrier properties towards 2-heptanone were also observed for MMT contents ≥5 wt% (Table 4). The permeability towards 2-nonanone of unfilled WG film was equal to 50.5 × 10^-12 g m^-1 s^-1 Pa^-1 and was largely lower than 2-heptanone permeability (453 × 10^-12 g m^-1 s^-1 Pa^-1). The effect of MMT addition was not quantified but was clearly observed since the 2-nonanone was not detectable anymore, indicating a strong decrease of transfer rate. Permeability is known to be governed by two mechanisms: diffusion and sorption. The fact that the permeability towards O2 and CO2 remained constant meant that no change in diffusivity or solubility was induced by the presence of nanoclays (in the range of studied MMT contents). The reduction of the permeability towards water vapour was attributed to a change in solubility rather than to a change in diffusivity. The assumption of the solubility effect was confirmed by the decrease in water vapour uptake with increasing filler content (Table 3). The decrease in WVP with increasing MMT loading may be related to the establishment of hydrophilic interactions between gluten proteins and nanoclays which resulted in a lower availability of the hydrophilic sites for water vapour. In the case of larger permeant molecules, such as 2-heptanone, the decrease in permeability was attributed to a significant decrease in diffusivity for increasing MMT contents (Table 4), i.e. to a tortuosity effect. The diffusion coefficients of 2-heptanone (114 g mol^-1) and 2-nonanone (142 g mol^-1) were slightly different, in agreement with the generally reported decrease in diffusivity with increasing molecular weight and steric hindrance.

827,Functional properties of wheat gluten montmorillonite nanocomposite films processed by casting.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Thermal stability']"," The thermal stability of raw materials (WG and MMT) as well as nanocomposite films has been studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The weight loss due to the formation of volatile products after thermal degradation was displayed as a function of temperature. The TGA results of WG powder and glycerol-plasticized WG are presented in Fig. 6 in the temperature range from 20 to 800 °C. During the thermal degradation in oxidative atmosphere, both samples exhibited a three steps decomposition with a maximum weight loss around 300 °C. The first step corresponded to the water loss and the second step to WG decomposition as well as those of glycerol, as already shown for glycerol-plasticized starch systems [31]. The degradation started at the same temperature for both samples (191 °C) but was faster for WG powder. This can be explained by a more heterogeneous system in the case of plasticized films. The third degradation, which corresponds to the oxidation of the partially decomposed WG, was observed in oxidative atmosphere but not in inert atmosphere (Fig. 6). The oxidative degradation began at higher temperatures for glycerol-plasticized film (500 °C) than for WG powder (423 °C). This reaction led to the quasi total decomposition of the sample (it remained a little less than 1% of residue which corresponds to mineral compounds present in WG). In the case of degradation under nitrogen, it remained about 20% of residue. The effect of MMT on the thermal stability of nanocomposites was studied in oxidative conditions and is presented in Fig. 7. Pure natural MMT exhibited a two-steps mechanism corresponding to water loss (first step) and to the weight loss due to the deshydroxylation of MMT over the 515-700 °C temperature range (second step) [32]. The mass loss percentages were 2.7% and 4.4% , respectively. The evolution of the weight loss of nanocomposite materials was the same as those of the pure matrix (Fig. 7). The incorporation of MMT led to a slight shift of the thermal decomposition of proteins and glycerol towards higher temperatures. The shift of the onset temperature of the thermal degradation was about 10 °C for 5 and 7.5 wt% filled materials. The increase of thermal stability in oxidative atmosphere of nanocomposite samples can be ascribed to a physical barrier effect of the layered silicates between the polymer medium and the superficial zone where flame combustion occurs, as already reported in the literature for many polymeric matrices [16]. The barrier effect concerns the diffusivity of both the volatile products generated during decomposition to the gas phase and the oxygen from the gas phase to the polymer matrix. Optimal thermal stabilization seemed to be obtained at a filler content of ca. 5 wt% . Increasing too much the amount of MMT did not lead to an increase in thermal stability. Such a behaviour could account from the change in nanocomposite morphology with the filler content, which did not allow maintaining a good thermal stability [16]. As reported for PLA-based nanocomposites [33], at high filler contents, intercalated species may dominate on exfoliated particles, thus limiting the barrier effect. After complete decomposition of the matrix, composite films displayed a residue proportional to their clay content. We were not able to observe any change of the temperature range of deshydroxylation of MMT. This could be attributed to the use of filler contents lower than 10 wt% , and also to the fact that the oxidative degradation of partially decomposed WG occurs in the same range of temperatures as the deshydroxylation of MMT.

830,Functional properties of wheat gluten montmorillonite nanocomposite films processed by casting.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Mechanical properties']"," Mechanical properties were investigated through tensile tests performed at 25 °C and 75% RH. Young modulus and ultimate tensile properties of materials are collected in Table 5. Relative values are plotted as a function of MMT content in Fig. 8. The unfilled matrix was a quite brittle material (ɛb = 58% ) compared to cast films plasticized with a higher amount of glycerol [34]. It was characterized by a very low tensile modulus (E = 3.7 MPa) and a low stress at break (σb = 1.8 MPa). The brittleness of the matrix has been attributed to its glass transition temperature that was close to room temperature. The glass transition temperature of plasticized-glycerol WG films stored at 75% RH was around 38 °C. This value has been estimated using the Couchman-Karasz equation [35] with Tg,water = 138 K, Tg,glycerol = 180 K, Tg,wheat gluten = 435 K, K1 = 2.1 [36], K2 = 2.26 [37] and a weight ratio of water equalled to 0.15. A higher rate of plasticizer would be necessary to obtain more ductile materials [8]. As expected, the nominal stress at break and tensile modulus increased with increasing MMT loading whereas the nominal strain at break decreased (Table 5). This behaviour was about the same as those observed when decreasing the glycerol content [8]. Two different behaviours were observed depending on MMT content. For MMT contents lower than 2.5 wt% , a slight improvement of both stress at break and modulus with no change in elongation at break could be noted whereas for MMT contents higher than 5 wt% an increase in stress at break and modulus with a dramatic decrease in strain at break was obtained. Improvement in tensile modulus could be first explained by the incorporation of rigid fillers in WG. It might also be attributed to interactions between the polymeric matrix and layered silicates via the formation of hydrogen bonds, as shown in water uptake experiments and already mentioned in literature [15]. Concerning the ultimate properties, it was interesting to observe that their evolutions were not linear over the studied range of MMT contents (Fig. 8). The stress at break, which expresses the ultimate strength that the material can endure before break, increased until a filler content of 5 wt% and then decreased. The strain at break remained constant until 2.5 wt% of MMT, then decreased from 58% down to a limit value of 16% for a filler content of 5 wt% . From the above results, it appeared that an optimal amount of MMT (5 wt% ) was necessary to achieve the greatest improvement of mechanical properties. As already shown by TEM observations and water vapour permeability measurements, this may be related to the formation of a percolating nanoclays network within the matrix at a weight fraction of MMT of at least 5 wt% . Such low filler content is not surprising because of the high surface area exposed to the polymer. "

833,Functional properties of wheat gluten montmorillonite nanocomposite films processed by casting.xml,['Conclusion']," Nanocomposite materials were obtained by casting and evaporating a mixture of WG (matrix) and MMT nanoclays (filler). TEM observations confirmed that layered silicates were homogeneously distributed in the matrix, but not fully exfoliated. MMT nanoparticles appeared to significantly decrease the water sensitivity of WG films. This effect could be attributed to a different structuring of protein network in the presence of layered silicates. Changes in barrier properties were only observed for water vapour and aroma compounds, for filler contents higher than 5 wt% . Changes in water vapour permeability were mainly attributed to the sorption of the permeant molecules. In the case of aroma compounds, changes in permeability were attributed to the sorption of molecules, but also to a significant diffusivity effect. It was shown that the increased tortuosity due to the addition of layered silicates had no significant influence on the diffusivity of small permeant molecules such as O2, CO2 or water vapour. Finally, thermal stability of WG was affected by MMT since the incorporation of MMT led to a slight shift of the thermal decomposition of proteins and glycerol towards higher temperatures (10 °C higher). An optimal filler content of 5 wt% was required for improving functional properties of WG-based materials. TEM observations showed that for filler contents higher than 5 wt% , layered silicates were able to connect together to form a continuous tridimensional network. All the results obtained agreed to show that 5 wt% was the critical weight fraction of MMT at the percolation. "
834,Gas barrier properties of nanocomposites based on in situ polymerized poly(n-butyl methacrylate) in the presence of surface modified montmorillonite.xml,['abstract']," Barrier membranes of poly(n-butylacrylate) were produced by the in situ polymerization of n-butylacrylate in the presence of surface modified natural montmorillonite. This two-stage process allowed control over the extent of intercalation, most likely leading to exfoliated nanostructures. The first stage of the process consisted of the organic modification of montmorillonite via ion exchange reactions with (acryloyloxy) ethyl alkylammonium cations. This process anchored chemically reactive species on the surface of natural clay and improved the mixing between the clay and the monomer. The second stage of the process comprised of the in situ polymerization of n-butyl methacrylate and the unsaturated acryloxy ethyl groups anchored on the surface of the clay. Resulting membranes were characterized in terms of their microstructure and diffraction (XRD), their thermal properties (TGA and DSC), and gas permeation properties. The resulting exfoliated morphology led to a decrease in gas permeability. Gas barrier properties of the nanocomposites were compared to those predicted by phenomenological models such as those of Cussler and Nielsen. "

839,Gas barrier properties of nanocomposites based on in situ polymerized poly(n-butyl methacrylate) in the presence of surface modified montmorillonite.xml,['Introduction']," Over the past two decades polymer / clay nanocomposites have drawn increasing interest due to the significant improvement of optical [1], mechanical [2], [3], flame resistant [4], [5], [6], [7], and barrier properties [8], [9], [10] in comparison to the corresponding pristine polymers. Polymer / clay nanocomposites are usually obtained via three major processes, which include melt intercalation, solution blending and in situ polymerization [11], [12]. The subsequent morphology of the nanocomposites depends on the molecular interactions between the polymer and clay particles. The three possible morphologies for these nanocomposites include immiscible, intercalated and exfoliated structures [11], [13]. In the immiscible phase, also known as phase separated morphology, the polymer does not penetrate in between the clay platelets. Intercalation is attained when polymer chains penetrate within the gallery space and induce expansion of the clay platelets. Exfoliation is characterized by a random distribution of the clay platelets due to extensive penetration of the polymer chains, resulting in the delamination of the clay platelets and the loss of the crystalline structure of the clay. Montmorillonite (MMT) clays, which pertain to the smectite family, are of special interest due to their high surface area and high aspect ratio [14], [15]. These two parameters are known to influence the barrier properties of the nanocomposite barrier membranes [16], [17], [18]. MMT crystal composition consists of two tetrahedrally coordinated sheets of silicon fused to an edge shared octahedral sheet of aluminum. This tetrahedral-octahedral-tetrahedral (TOT) conformation of MMT generates a stacking of platelets perpendicular to the direction of the sheets. The stacking of the TOT sheets leads to regular van der Waals gaps between the layers. The layered silicates have a negative charge due to the heterovalent substitution which resides in the octahedral layer [19]. The charge deficiency extends throughout the whole lattice, forcing the counter ions to distribute within the interior of the crystal. The counter ions, which are usually alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as Na^+, Li^+ or Ca^2+, reside between the sheets, minimizing the overall electrostatic energy. The cations in the interlayer occupy the basal spacing of the silicate sheets, whose distance is determined by the nature of the cation as well as the degree of hydration. Natural clays, such as MMT, may be organically modified to render the silicate sheets more organophilic and compatible with the penetrating polymer [20], [21]. Alkylphosphonium and alkylammonium cations are commonly used for this purpose to modify the surface of the clays [11], [22]. These surface modifiers decrease the surface energy [23] of the silicate platelets, and increase the basal spacing between the layers [24], [25]. According to Bergaya and Lagaly [26], the preferred method for synthesis of organically modified clays is via ion exchange reactions. Some surfactants added to the silicate platelets can also react with monomers and initialize polymerization reactions [27]. The reacting surfactant group anchored on the silicate surface may improve the dispersion of the silicate platelets in the polymer matrix, eventually leading to improved gas barrier properties and mechanical properties [28], [29]. This work focuses on the synthesis of intercalated / exfoliated poly(n-butylmethacrylate) / clay nanocomposites via in situ polymerization. Furthermore it examines the effect of the processing method prior to surface modification of the silicate platelets on the mechanical, thermal and gas barrier properties of the nanocomposites. "

Bragg's equation, 2d sin θ = nλ, was used to calculate the basal spacing of the modified clay as well as of the pristine clay. The characteristic d001 diffraction peak for Cloisite Na^+ in the 2θ region is located at 7.5 °, d001 = 1.15 nm. The modification of the clays with (acryloyloxy) ethyl alkyl ammonium shifts the d001 peak to lower values in the 2θ region, rendering sonicated clay's d001 = 1.43 nm, and stirred clay's d001 = 1.42 nm. This shift suggests an increase in the basal spacing of the silicate platelets. The increase of the basal spacing is due to the penetration and grafting of the quaternary salt via ion exchange to the clay platelets. The indexing of the d001 peak in the diffractograms of both sonicated and stirred modified clays also suggests that the morphology of the clays is intercalated. The XRD diffractogram for SPBMA-3 nanocomposite membrane can be seen in Fig. 2. The d001 peak for the SPBMA-3 could not be indexed. This peak was also non-existent in the XRD diffractograms of all other nanocomposite membranes in the two series.

The polymer / clay nanocomposite membranes have a higher Tg than that of the pristine PBMA. This may be due to the increased restricted segmental chain mobility of the poly(n-butyl methacrylate) anchored to the silicate surface [1], [31], [32], [33].

The first stage is located between the temperature region of 100-225 °C, and is associated with the volatilization of remnant chloroform solvent molecules encapsulated within the pure polymer and polymer / clay membranes. This stage also provides the removal of excess water molecules sorbed onto the surface of these membranes. The second thermal decomposition stage is located between 225 and 450 °C and presents a dramatic weight loss related to the thermal degradation by depolymerization of the poly(n-butyl methacrylate) [34], [35], [36], [37]. Table 3 summarizes the onset temperature and the temperatures at 10% and 50% weight loss for all the samples. The onset decomposition temperature of the poly(n-butyl methacrylate) / clay nanocomposites is slightly higher in comparison with the pristine poly(n-butyl methacrylate). This increase suggests that the addition of modified natural montorillonite to the polymer matrix delays the thermal decomposition of the nanocomposite by providing a local heat sink in the matrix [7]. The effect is more pronounced in samples whose clay particles have been sonicated. "
855,Gas barrier properties of nanocomposites based on in situ polymerized poly(n-butyl methacrylate) in the presence of surface modified montmorillonite.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Permeation data']"," As explained in the previous sections, the in situ polymerization of poly(n-butyl methacrylate) / clay composites most likely leads to an exfoliated morphology in case of all the nanocomposite membranes. The exfoliated morphology increases the effective surface area of the clay in the matrix, thus increasing the tortuous pathway for the permeating gas molecules. As seen in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 increasing the clay concentration in the polymer matrix leads to an expected decrease in permeation values. For example, the CO2 permeation obtained for the pristine poly(n-butyl methacrylate) membrane is 56.3±1.8 barrer. The addition of 5 wt% nanoclay in the matrix decreases the CO2 permeability value to 24.6±0.9 barrer. This represents a 56% decrease in permeability in comparison with the pristine polymer sample. Similar results are seen in the permeabilities of the other gases. Whether or not the clay particles are sonicated during surface modification also has an effect on the barrier properties of the polymer / clay nanocomposites. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the effect of dispersing the nanoclay particles via sonication improves barrier properties of all samples, particularly of those having the highest clay content, 5 wt% . For example, the CO2 permeability of SPBMA-5 is 25 barrer in comparison to 30 barrer of the PBMA-5. These results suggest that pre-treating the clays with sonication increases the dispersion of the clay particles substantially. This in turn generates more tortuous pathways for permeating gas molecules [38]. "

858,Gas barrier properties of nanocomposites based on in situ polymerized poly(n-butyl methacrylate) in the presence of surface modified montmorillonite.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Gas permeation models']"," Phenomenological models such as those of Cussler [39], [40], and Nielsen [41] have been used to predict the effective permeation properties of polymer / clay nanocomposites. These models are based on ideal conditions, such as complete exfoliation of the flake platelets, perfect alignment of the flakes in a perpendicular direction to the flow of the permeating molecules [42], and the assumption that the type of polymer used as the matrix has no effect on the effective ratio of permeabilities. The mathematical representation of Nielsen's model is presented in Eq. (1).(1)PoP=1+α / 2ϕ1-ϕwhere, P and Po are the permeability of the composite film and that of the pristine polymer, respectively, ϕ is the volume fraction of the filler and α is the aspect ratio, defined as the ratio of half the width to thickness of the impermeable flakes. The volume fraction of the clay content in the matrix can be determined by the use of Eq. (2):(2)ϕ=11+ρC(1-MC) / ρPMCwhere ϕ is the volume fraction, ρC and ρp are the density of the nanoclay and the polymer, and Mc is the mass fraction. In a similar model, Cussler et al. [39], considered that the steady state flux in a composite membrane, is dominated by wiggles around the impermeable flakes. Thus the flux is dependent on the loading of the nanoclay in the matrix and the geometry of the flakes, which in this case is represented by the specific aspect ratio of the flakes [43]. Cussler's equation is as follows:(3)P0P=1+α2ϕ21-ϕ The parameters in Eq. (3) are the same as those in Nielsen's equation (1). These models can predict the ratio of the permeation of the pristine polymer to that of the nanocomposite membrane as a function of clay content and aspect ratio. The experimental gas permeation data was fitted to both models using the aspect ratio as an adjustable parameter. The results can be seen in Fig. 6, Fig. 7. Fig. 6 shows CO2 and O2 permeation data fitted with Nielsen's model. For examples, the adjusted aspect ratio, α, obtained by fitting CO2 permeation of the SPBMA samples was between 100 and 150. The aspect ratio of the PBMA samples was slightly lower, falling between 100 and 120. When fitting the O2 permeation data, the aspect ratio of the SPBMA series fell between 35 and 80, while that of the PBMA samples was between 20 and 50. The fact that there is a discrepancy between the adjusted aspect ratio of the CO2 and the O2 permeabilities in the different polymer systems reflects the idealized nature of the phenomenological models. The kinetic diameters of O2 and CO2 are very similar, hence the differences in reduction in the permeability ratios at the same clay loading cannot be attributed to molecular size differences. Furthermore, other gases such as N2 and CH4 do not demonstrate the same magnitude of decrease in P / Po with clay content as does CO2. One possible explanation is that CO2 plasticizes the polymer matrix, leading to high values of the intrinsic permeability, Po. With the addition of the clay, the plasticization effect diminishes, decreasing the effective permeability, not only due to the increased tortuosity around the clay particles, but also because the volume fraction of the polymer in the sample is lower and there is less material to plasticize. Hence, the ratio P / Po at a given volume fraction of clay would be lower for CO2 than O2. Furthermore, the consistently higher aspect ratios of the samples, whose clay particles have been sonicated again suggests that these samples have better dispersion than those whose clay particles have been processed by stirring. Fig. 7 shows the fit of Cussler's model to the experimental permeation data. As is the case for Nielsen's model at the lowest clay loading of 1 wt% , the apparent aspect ratio seen by the permeating gas molecules is similar in the case of nanocomposites prepared with sonicated as well as with stirred clays. But as the clay loading increases to the highest amount of 5 wt% of clay, the differences in the aspect ratio between the stirred and sonicated series widen, especially in the case of O2 permeability. Again, this is reflection of the deviation from the idealized structure of Cussler's model. Actually, Cussler et al., acknowledged that the model might present some variability [43], attributed to the random orientation of the flakes in the matrix [40]. Also, it should be pointed out that aspect ratios in the range of 50-100 are consistent with those observed by other groups using the same models [24], [38], [44] as well as those conducting TEM studies [45], [46], [47]. Finally, in comparison to barrier properties achieved by preparing nanocomposites by simply mixing the clay particles in a polymer solution [45], the in situ polymerization in the presence of exfoliated clay platelets provides a better fit to Cussler and Nielsen's idealized phenomenological model in predicting permeation values of polymer / clay nanocomposite systems.

The grafting of alkylammine group allowed an anchoring site for the in situ polymerization poly(n-butyl methacrylate). The polymerization reaction produced barrier membranes with exfoliated morphologies, as determined via XRD analysis. Sonication of the clays before polymerization of the matrix lead to higher molecular weights than when the clays were stirred due to better particle dispersion and accessibility of the monomer to reaction sites. The addition of clay particles to the polymer matrix improved the mechanical properties of the polymer and also improved the thermal stability of the nanocomposites in comparison to the pristine polymer. The exfoliation of the clay platelets provided a decrease in gas permeability of up to 50% for certain gases. This effect was achieved at relatively low clay loadings of 1-5 wt% . Phenomenological models of effective gas permeabilities in nanocomposites, such as those of Nielsen and Cussler, although able to fit the experimental data are still too idealized to explain differences in effective permeabilities of different gases through the same nanocomposite.

Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the microstructure obtained. Thermal behavior of the composites analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis was observed to enhance significantly with the filler volume fraction. The gas permeation through the nanocomposite films markedly decreased with augmenting the filler volume fraction. The decrease in the gas permeation was even more significant than through the composites with ammonium treated montmorillonite. Better thermal behavior of the organic modification owing to the delayed onset of degradation hindered the interface degradation along with detrimental side reactions with polymer itself. Transmission electron microscopic studies indicated the presence of mixed morphology i.e., single layers and the tactoids of varying thicknesses in the composites. The crystallization behavior of polypropylene remained unaffected with OMMT addition.

867,Gas permeation and mechanical properties of polypropylene nanocomposites with thermally-stable imidazolium modified clay.xml,['Introduction']," A relatively new approach to address the ever-increasing requirement of high-end polymeric products is represented by organically modified plate like layered silicates which can be dispersed into nanometer thin platelets in the polymer matrix [1], [2], [3]. Such polymer nanocomposites have attracted tremendous attention owing to the substantial property improvement at minimal filler volume fractions. The properties of the composites are synergistically derived from the organic and inorganic components of the composites, therefore, a uniform dispersion and distribution of the filler is of utmost importance. Aluminosilicates, especially montmorillonite, has received significant attention as the inorganic filler to prepare such composites owing to their easy swelling in water leading to 1 nm thick platelets [4], [5]. The exchange of alkali metal cations present on the surface of the platelets with long chain alkyl ammonium cations is thus achieved to reduce the surface energy and to make the treated montmorillonite more compatible in the polymer matrix leading to its nanoscale dispersion [6], [7]. The various properties which could be enhanced significantly include the mechanical and barrier performance, heat deflection temperature, ablation and flammability resistance etc [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Melt intercalation has been by far the most convenient way to synthesize polymer nanocomposites. However, significantly higher temperatures are required for melt intercalation process and the subsequent processing protocols. The organic ammonium modifications have been observed to have onset of degradation as low as 180 °C by TGA studies [13]. The thermal degradation was observed to follow the Hoffmann degradation path involving the early breakage of weaker C-N bond in the ammonium modification. Rupture of even a small number of such bonds can significantly change the thermodynamics of the system and interfacial interactions because of the changes in the structure of the surfactant and production of low molecular weight species consequently affecting the physical and mechanical properties like viscosity, molecular weight, glass transition temperature and flammability etc. as reported in the literature [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. As polypropylene is a material of choice for a number of applications, inorganic fillers are commonly compounded with polypropylene to further enhance its properties [19], [20], [21]. However, the high melt temperatures required along with the high mechanical shear used in the melt intercalation and processing operations poses a concern for the thermal stability of the ammonium modification. Temperatures more than 200 °C are generally employed for such processes which are almost equal or higher than the initial onset of degradation of the alkyl ammonium groups. Furthermore, the fundamental theoretical investigations on the thermodynamics and kinetics of polymer melt intercalation and hybrid formation have assumed the perfect stability of the organic modification even at higher temperatures [22], [23]. Therefore, no theoretical studies are also available which systematically quantify the thermal stability of OMMT at high melt intercalation temperatures and its possible effect on the physical and mechanical performance of nanocomposites. However, many approaches have been tried to circumvent this limitation of thermal stability of the ammonium cations attached to the clay surface [24], [25], [26], [27], out of which the use of other thermally stable cations such as phosphonium, pyridinium and imidazolium can offer a good alternative to the ammonium salts [28], [29]. Intensive thermal studies carried out especially on imidazolium salts have proved their much better thermal response as compared to the alkyl ammonium cations both in the presence and absence of oxygen as degrading atmosphere [28]. Although the thermal stability of such salts was observed to be inversely proportional to the length of the alkyl chain attached to the imidazolium group, but still the thermal stability values for the long alkyl chains required for better intercalation and hence exfoliation of the clay platelets were high enough to sustain the higher compounding temperatures [30], [31]. Increasing the substitution of the imidazolium ions also was reported to increase the thermal stability due to the removal of the ring hydrogens. However, only a few studies using these imidazolium salts for the synthesis of polymer nanocomposites with mostly polystyrene as matrix have been reported [32], [33]. He et al. reported the synthesis of polypropylene nanocomposites with monoalkylimidazolium montmorillonite using in situ polymerization approach [34]. The goal of the present investigation was to study the effect of thermally stable imidazolium treated montmorillonite on the gas permeation and mechanical behavior of polypropylene nanocomposites. A dialkyl chain imidazolium salt was synthesized and the composites containing different volume fractions of the OMMT were prepared by melt intercalation. Correlations of the final composite properties were established with the inorganic filler volume fraction. "

The contents were stirred at room temperature for 2 h under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was then placed in an oil bath heated at 55 °C and the reaction was allowed to continue overnight. The reaction mixture was cooled to obtain a white precipitate of imidazolium salt which was filtered and washed extensively with ethyl acetate. The salt was then dried at room temperature under reduced pressure. The synthesis of the salt was confirmed by proton NMR spectrum collected on a Bruker 300 spectrometer with observing frequencies of 300 MHz. Fig. 1 shows the structure of the imidazolium salt synthesized. For the exchange of the imidazolium cation on the clay surface, it was always ensured that the OMMT is free from any excess modifier molecules after the exchange, which if present can adversely affect the properties of composites owing to their low temperature stability [13], [36], [37]. The exchange of the imidazolium salt on the montmorillonite surface was achieved by following the process reported earlier [38]. Both degree of exchange and the purity of the modified clay were monitored by Hi-Res TGA. If the TGA thermogram indicated the presence of unattached modifier molecules, the washing step was repeated until the purity of the product was satisfactory. Finally the modified clay was suspended in 400 mL of dioxane, sonicated and freeze dried. The freeze dried clay was sieved (60 μm mesh) to obtain the fine OMMT powder. "

Tensile tests on the stamped samples were carried out (ISO 527-1) at room temperature using a Zwick Z020 universal testing machine with testXpert 9.01 software (Zwick, Ulm, Germany) coupled with a Video-Extensometer V4.19.02 (Messphysik, Furstenfeld, Austria) for accurate measurement. The drawing speed of 0.1 mm min^-1 was used for the measurement of elastic modulus and modulus was determined in the range of 0.05-0.25% strain. A speed of 6 mm min^-1 was used for the measurement of other tensile properties and an average of five measurements was taken. DSC 7 (Perkin Elmer, Norwark, CT) was used to carry out differential scanning calorimetric measurements at a heating rate of 10 °C min^-1, adopting the procedure for measuring heat capacities [40]. A temperature range (100-180 °C) was used to calculate the melting enthalpies of the composite samples followed by necessary corrections to represent the thermal behavior of pure polypropylene in the composites. High-resolution (Hi-Res) thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of OMMT and composites, in which the heating rate is coupled to mass loss, that is, the sample temperature is not raised until the mass loss at a particular temperature is completed, was performed on a Q500 thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). All measurements were carried out in air in the temperature range 50-900 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min^-1. Both degree of exchange and the purity of the OMMT were monitored by Hi-Res TGA. Dynamic TGA measurement of OMMT was carried out by first conditioning the sample to 140 °C followed by heating to 180 °C and keeping the sample at this temperature for 90 min. TGA of the composites was also performed at the same specifications in order to study the thermal behavior of the composites as a function of the increasing amount of OMMT. X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on a wide angle Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer (Scintag Inc., Cupertino, CA) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) in reflection mode and bright-field TEM (Zeiss EM 912 Omega) was used to study the microstructure of the nanocomposites as reported earlier [39]. The SEM investigation was carried out on Hitachi S-900 field emission scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. "
872,Gas permeation and mechanical properties of polypropylene nanocomposites with thermally-stable imidazolium modified clay.xml,['Results and discussion']," Dialkyl imidazolium treated montmorillonite was employed in the present study to investigate the effect of more thermally stable organic modification on the properties of OMMT-polypropylene nanocomposites. The compounding temperatures were kept low in order not to degrade the modification and the polymer, but high enough to ensure homogenous mixing. The long octadecyl chains, in commonly used dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium salts, help in significantly separating the clay platelets thus reducing the attractive forces among them and their similar chemical nature as polypropylene is also expected to help in better intermixing at the interface. The imidazolium salt synthesized in the present study also contained two long alkyl chains thus expecting to achieve similar compatibilizing forces. Alkyl chains of two different lengths were used in order to avoid its possible phase separation at the interface with the polymer which sometimes have been reported for dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium modification owing to its more ordered structure [41]. A comparison of the thermal behavior of the montmorillonite treated with dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium [38] and 1-decyl-2-methyl-3-octadecyl imidazolium salts have been shown in Fig. 2. As is clearly visible in Fig. 2a, the degradation of ammonium treatment starts earlier than the imidazolium counterpart by around 50 °C. A sharp degradation was also observed in the ammonium treatment at this point, which indicates the presence of some unattached modifier molecules which are difficult to wash especially in dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium treated clay. This early degradation can seriously marginalize the improvement in the composite properties [13], [36], [37]. Apart from the delayed onset of degradation in the imidazolium treated clay, the peak degradation temperature also is higher by almost 35 °C as compared to the ammonium treated clay. A dynamic thermal analysis of the two montmorillonites in air was also carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. The OMMT powders were stabilized at 140 °C and then heated to 180 °C and kept at 180 °C under isothermal conditions for 90 min. As is clearly visible, the ammonium treated clay shows faster thermal degradation than the imidazolium counterpart. Although the difference in the amount of degradation of the two organo-montmorillonites is not significant, but owing to the fact that the main mechanism of the degradation being the breakage of the weaker C-N bond, therefore, breaking of even small number of such bonds can seriously change the structure of the surfactant and its interaction with the polymer. Thus, the thermal analysis clearly confirmed the better thermal behavior of the imidazolium treated montmorillonite. Table 1 shows the oxygen permeation coefficients of the composites containing 0-4 vol% of the OMMT. The oxygen permeation through the composite films was observed to decrease substantially as the filler volume fraction was increased. The oxygen permeation decreased from 89 cm^3 μm / m^2 day mmHg for the pure polypropylene films to 48 cm^3 μm / m^2 day mmHg for the composite films containing 4 vol% filler fraction, thus, bringing about a decrease of almost 50% in the oxygen permeation. For comparison, relative oxygen permeation values of the composites containing imidazolium treated clay have been plotted along with the composites containing dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium modified clay with same volume fractions in Fig. 3. Dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium treated clay was observed to have the best permeation resistance among a number of other OMMT with different ammonium salts as reported earlier [38]. A decrease of around 35% in oxygen permeation was observed for this clay at 4% filler volume fraction. A much better oxygen permeation behavior for the imidazolium treated montmorillonite can definitely be attributed to its better thermal stability. As the permeation properties are sensitive to the interface and interfacial interactions, therefore, the improved permeation behavior can be more safely attributed to the interplay of the thermal stability and resulting interfacial interactions [12], [38]. A permeation value of 80 cm^3 μm / m^2 day mmHg through the composite film containing 3 vol% of untreated montmorillonite also confirms the importance of interfacial compatibility between the phases of composite. An important thing to note is the relative lower d-spacing of the clay as compared to the 2C18 ammonium treated clay (2.24 as compared to 2.51). The composites with imidazolium modified montmorillonite therefore also have lower basal plane spacing as compared to the 2C18 counterparts (Table 1). As has been observed earlier that the higher d-spacing may lead to enhanced exfoliation of the clay platelets owing to the decrease of attractive forces among them, therefore, it may be possible that the imidazolium composites may have suffered in this regard. Therefore, the improved permeation resistance is a combined result of better thermal stability and possible lower extent of exfoliation owing to lower basal plane spacing and hence less stronger interfacial interactions. Apart from that, a decrease in the basal plane spacing was also observed with respect to the increase in filler volume fraction as detailed in Fig. 4 as well as Table 1, but it was too insignificant and it can be safely said that no or minimum intercalation in the composites could be observed. However, owing to better interfacial interactions and the effect of shearing forces, a decrease in the tactiod thickness and hence increase in the aspect ratio can still be expected. As the X-ray peaks have a qualitative nature owing to the sensitivity of the peak intensity and peak width to the platelet orientation, processing conditions and the sample preparation, estimation of extent of intercalation and exfoliation as well as the tactoid thickness is therefore very difficult. Subsequently, to supplement the X-ray diffraction results, microscopic analysis of the composites was carried out with transmission electron microscopy. Fig. 5a-c shows the TEM micrographs of composite containing 3 vol% of the filler fraction. A mixed morphology with single clay layers and tactoids of different thickness were observed. The clay layers were also observed to be bent, folded and completely misaligned. Similar morphology was also observed in the polypropylene composites with dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium treated montmorillonite [38]. The micrographs were also taken at different magnifications and no global orientation of the platelets could be observed at any magnification. However, one important thing to notice here is that a partial exfoliation could still be achieved even without the use of a compatibilizer, generally used in synthesizing polypropylene nanocomposites. Fig. 5d also shows the SEM micrograph of the 3 vol% OMMT-polypropylene composites. The thin platy tactoids could be observed which though are misoriented, but are also uniformly distributed. Thus, it confirms that the morphology suggested by the TEM microgaphs was present throughout the microstructure of the composites. Tensile properties of the OMMT-polypropylene nanocomposites containing different filler volume fractions have been detailed in Table 2. As can be seen, the modulus increased monotonously with augmenting the filler volume fraction (Fig. 6a) indicating enhanced stress transfer to the inorganic platelets. An increase of nearly 35% was observed for the composite containing 4 vol% of the OMMT. Relative yield strength (Fig. 6b) of the composites was observed to decay with filler volume fraction indicating lack of attractive interactions at the interface and the presence of tactoids. The other tensile properties of the composites have been plotted with respect to the filler volume fraction in Fig. 7. The stress at break also had slight decrease with the filler volume fraction possibly due to the strain hardening of the confined polymer and also the presence of tactoids (Fig. 7a). Decrease of yield strain (Fig. 7b) was observed owing to similar stain hardening because of the confined polymer chains indicating the brittleness with increase in filler volume fraction. Relative oxygen permeation has also been plotted against the relative tensile modulus in Fig. 8. A good correlation was observed to exist between the two, indicating the synergistic improvement of the properties. It also indicates that if the interface of the clay surface modification is optimally designed, better composite properties and microstructure can still be achieved even without the use of external compatibilizers. It has been earlier reported that incorporation of OMMT did not have any significant effect on the crystallization of polypropylene under the processing conditions used [39]. Calorimetric behavior of the imidazolium composites was also carried out in order to verify this observation. The calorimetric results of the composites with respect to filler volume fraction have been shown in Table 3. There were no observable variations in the onset and peak melting and crystallization temperatures. Also the degree of crystallinity calculated from the enthalpy of melting of polymer in the composite compared with the enthalpy of purely crystalline polymer was found be fairly constant. This leads to the conclusion that the improvements in the permeation and mechanical properties of the composites could be solely attributed to the exfoliation and interfacial interactions. The thermal behavior of the composites carrying different filler fractions was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis in order to study the effect of OMMT on the stability of the composites. Fig. 9a shows the TGA thermograms of pure polypropylene and the OMMT-polypropylene nanocomposites. Addition of only 1 vol% of the inorganic filler fraction improved the thermal behavior tremendously. Further additions also significantly improved the thermal degradation behavior of the composites with the composite containing 4 vol% of the filler showing the best thermal response. Thus, the thermal behavior of the OMMT-polypropylene composites was tremendously improved on the incorporation of the clay. The synergism between polypropylene and the OMMT is clearly evident from Fig. 9b, where the TGA thermograms of the imidazolium clay, pure polypropylene and the composite containing 4 vol% of the filler have been compared. The thermal response of the composite was better than any of its constituents indicating the better dispersion of the clay. "

884,Gas permeation and mechanical properties of polypropylene nanocomposites with thermally-stable imidazolium modified clay.xml,['Conclusions']," In this work, polypropylene nanocomposites with imidazolium treated montmorillonite were prepared and subsequently characterized for their permeation and mechanical properties. The isothermal and non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the delayed onset and peak degradation for the imidazolium surface modification ionically bound to the montmorillonite surface as compared to the dimethyldioctadecylammonium counterpart commonly used. The oxygen permeation properties improved markedly with a decrease of nearly 50% at 4 vol% of filler fraction significantly better than 2C18 ammonium composites. A mixed morphology consisting of clay tactoids of varying thicknesses represented the microstructure of the composites. A partial delamination could still be achieved even without the use of commonly added compatibilizers. Tensile modulus linearly increased with filler volume fraction. Decreases in other tensile properties indicated lack of stronger interfacial interactions, strain amplification and the presence of tactoids. The improvement in the overall composite properties seem to be a combined result of better thermal stability and interfacial interactions. The addition of OMMT did not affect the crystallization behavior of polypropylene. The thermal stability of the composites was observed to improve significantly with increasing filler volume fraction. "
885,Gas permeation properties of poly(lactic acid).xml,['abstract']," The need for the development of polymeric materials based on renewable resources has led to the development of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) which is being produced from a feedstock of corn rather than petroleum. The present study examines the permeation of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane in amorphous films of PLA cast from solution. The properties of PLA are compared to other commodity plastics and it is shown that PLA permeation closely resembles that of polystyrene. At 30 °C, N2 permeation in PLA is 1.3 (10^-10 cm^3 (STP) cm / cm^2 s cmHg) and the activation energy is 11.2 kJ / mol. For oxygen the corresponding values are 3.3 (10^-10 cm^3(STP) cm / cm^2 s cm Hg) and 11.1 kJ / mol. The values for carbon dioxide permeation are 1.2 (10^-10 cm^3 (STP) cm / cm^2 s cmHg) and 6.1 kJ / mol. For methane values of 1.0 (10^-10 cm^3 (STP) cm / cm^2 s cmHg) and an activation energy of 13.0 kJ / mol are found. Studies with pure gases show that polymer chain branching and small changes in l:d stereochemical content have no effect on permeation properties. Crystallinity is found to dominate permeation properties in a biaxially oriented film. The separation factor for a CO2 / CH4 mixed gas system is measured between 0 and 50 °C and does not deviate significantly from the calculated ideal separation factor; at 0 °C the separation factor is 16, a value that suggests continued studies of PLA as a separation medium are warranted.

891,Gas permeation properties of poly(lactic acid).xml,"['Introduction', 'Green aspects']"," Currently, most polymeric materials are based on non-renewable fossil resources. Incineration of these materials makes a net contribution to atmospheric CO2 and plastics currently account for an excess of 20% of the nation’s landfills [1]. In addition, many widely used materials are made from noxious or toxic monomers. The need for the development of “green” plastics based on renewable resources has led to the development of poly(lactic acid) (PLA). The lactide monomer from which PLA is made comes from lactic acid, a fermentation product available from the conversion of dextrose. Dextrose is a renewable feedstock available from corn milling. The pending widespread availability of PLA raises interesting and important questions regarding its inherent permeation properties. These properties are explored in the present study in which the pure and mixed gas permeabilities of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and methane through PLA are presented. The present study presents results for different grades of PLA and blends of chain architectures. "
892,Gas permeation properties of poly(lactic acid).xml,"['Introduction', 'PLA chemistry']"," Due to the chiral nature of lactic acid, the stereochemistry of PLA is complex. Fig. 1 shows the l-and d-enantiomers of lactic acid along with its possible dimer rings and the polymer chain structure. Lactide is used as the monomer in synthesizing the polymers used in this study. Control of the ratio of l:d monomer content is an important molecular feature of PLAs that has a large effect on material properties through its effect on crystallization. Generally, greater stereochemical purity (i.e. a higher l-content) favors crystallization. "

894,Gas permeation properties of poly(lactic acid).xml,"['Experimental', 'Materials']"," All polymers in this study were provided by Cargill-Dow Polymers. The PLAs were synthesized via melt polymerization with stannous octoate serving as catalyst. Polymers with l:d ratios of 95:5, 96:4, and 98:2 were studied. A common method of imparting different rheological properties into plastics is to alter the chain architecture through the introduction of branching. Branched samples of the 96:4 grade materials were produced through peroxide initiated cross-linking of linear material by reactive extrusion [2]. Six different blends varying in the ratio of branched to linear content were studied for samples having an l:d ratio of 96:4; increments of 20% by weight were employed. All blends (including the base materials) were subjected to the same thermal and shear history in a twin-screw extruder. For the samples having an l:d ratio of 98:2, only the linear polymer chain structure was investigated. The 95:5 samples were biaxially oriented films made with draw ratios of 3×3 and were used as received from Cargill-Dow Polymers. Reagent grade methylene chloride that was 99.6% pure was obtained from Aldrich and used as received for the solvent for membrane casting. High purity gases were used to ensure accuracy of the data. He, N2, and H2 were 99.999% pure, CO2 and CH4 were 99.99% pure, and O2 was 99.993% pure. CH4 was obtained from Scott Specialty Gases and the remaining gases were obtained from General Air. "
895,Gas permeation properties of poly(lactic acid).xml,"['Experimental', 'Methods']"," PLA films were cast from a 5 wt.% solution in methylene chloride using a Gardner casting blade onto a glass plate. After solvent evaporation and annealing overnight in a vacuum oven at 40 °C, films were notched and the thickness was measured using a Tencor P-10 Surface Profilometer. Films were subsequently floated off the glass in a water bath, recovered, and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 40 °C and 2500 Pa vacuum. Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the flow system used for measuring gas permeation through the PLA films. The films were placed inside a Millipore membrane cell using a cross-flow configuration with a partial pressure difference of approximately 200 cmHg. A water bath was used to ensure the membrane was at a constant temperature. An SRI 8610C gas chromatograph was used with a porous polymer column. The GC utilized a flame ionization detector for methane and a thermals conductivity detector for all non-hydrocarbon gases. Absolute membrane pressures were kept the same on the feed and permeant sides and ranged from 1 to 2 atm. The crystallinity of the PLA films was measured on a Perkin-Elmer DSC 7 differential scanning calorimeter. The glass transition (Tg) and melting temperatures for the PLA samples tested has previously been reported as approximately 58 and 153 °C, respectively [3]. Crystallinity measurements were started above Tg to reduce the amount of recrystallization during testing. Accordingly, the samples were tested by ramping the temperature from 125 to 200 °C at 15 °C / min. For the calculation of crystallinity, a value of 93.6 J / g was used for a 100% crystalline PLA [4].

There is no statistical difference between the 96:4 and 98:2 samples. Fig. 6 shows the results of the linear / branched study for the 96:4 samples. The error bar for the 100% linear sample is calculated from data obtained from three separate runs with different film samples. Within the standard deviation of the test results, there is no difference between the linear / branched samples for N2 permeation. This demonstrates that at least for a relatively small gas penetrant like N2 there is no dependence of the free volume distribution on the long chain branching present in the samples. Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of N2 permeation in 100% linear PLA having an l:d ratio of 96:4. An activation energy of permeation (Ep) can be calculated from Eq. (1) [5].(1)P=P0exp-EpRTwhere P is the permeability, P0 the pre-exponential factor, R the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature of the membrane. The activation energy for N2 permeation through PLA is calculated to be 11.2 kJ / mol. The results for nitrogen permeation can be compared to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), another polyester. At 30 °C, N2 permeation in PET is 0.008 (10^-10 cm^3 (STP) cm / cm^2 s cmHg) [6], while PLA has a value of 1.3. The activation energy for permeation for PET is 26.4 kJ / mol [5] as compared to 11.2 kJ / mol for PLA. Although, PET and PLA are both polyesters, PET contains aromatic rings in the polymer chain backbone which reduces free volume and chain mobility.

913,Gas permeation properties of poly(lactic acid).xml,"['Results and discussion', 'CH4/CO2 mixed gas results']"," The availability of both methane and carbon dioxide permeation data allows for a simple screening of separating ability. An important commercial use of membranes is in the separation of CH4 and CO2 for the natural gas industry. The ideal separation factor (α) as a function of temperature is calculated from Eq. (2) using the data for the pure gases and is shown in Fig. 14.(2)αCO2 / CH4ideal=PCO2PCH4For the 100% linear (96:4) sample, the ideal separation factor varies from approximately 10 at 50 °C to 16 at 0 °C. Often the real separation factor is not equal to the ideal separation factor because of plasticizing effects of the dissolved gases on the polymer. Therefore, results for a gas mixture of 50% CO2 and 50% CH4, by volume for PLA samples with an l:d ratio of 98:2 and 96:4 are analyzed. Fig. 15 shows the separation factor for the mixed gas system. While there is no difference between the observed separation factor and the ideal separation factor, this finding must be interpreted in light of the low pressures utilized in the experiments. Plasticization depends on concentration which in turn depends on the pressure. The ability of CO2 to plasticize polymers is material dependent and typically occurs at elevated partial pressures [8], [9]. The pressure used in this study is approximately 200 cmHg — a relatively low pressure. Significant effects could still be present at elevated pressures not obtainable with the experimental apparatus used in these studies. A rule of thumb is that a separation factor greater than 20 is required for a membrane to be economically feasible for industrial applications [10]. At 0 °C PLA has a CO2 / CH4 separation factor of 16 suggesting that further studies of PLA are warranted. In particular, modifications to raise the Tg of PLA could result in improved separating power as suggested by the temperature dependence of α. "

While PLA may prove valuable in a yet to be discovered separation application, it is clear that its permeation properties are sufficiently robust to allow its application in many important products.

918,Gas permeation properties of poly(lactic acid).xml,['Conclusions']," The present study examines the permeation of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane in various grades of PLA. Crystallinity measurements show that the cast films are less than 4% crystalline while the biaxially oriented film is approximately 16% crystalline. As expected, measurements show that crystallinity profoundly impacts permeation. Accordingly, stereochemical purity and orientation imparted during processing are important effects in controlling the permeation properties of PLA. Studies with the pure gases show that changes in polymer chain branching and l:d ratios have no effect on the permeation properties of small gases. However, due to its higher crystallinity the biaxially oriented film has a CH4 permeation that is 4.5 times lower than the other films. The permeation properties of PLA for all gases studied are very similar to polystyrene. The separation factor for a CO2 / CH4 mixed gas system was calculated at a variety of temperatures and did not deviate significantly from the ideal separation factor. At 0 °C the separation factor is 16, a value that suggests continued studies of PLA as a separation medium are warranted. "
919,Gas separation properties of polyether-based polyurethane–silica nanocomposite membranes.xml,['abstract']," In this study, the effect of silica nanoparticles on the gas permeation properties of polyether-based polyurethane membrane was investigated. Polyether-based polyurethane was synthesized by bulk two-step polymerization of polypropylene glycol / hexamethylenediisocyanate (HMDI) / 1,4-butanediol (BDO) in mole ratios of 1:3:2. Silica nanoparticles were prepared through the sol-gel method by hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). Polyurethane and polyurethane-silica nanocomposite membranes were prepared by solution blending and casting method. The prepared polyurethane-silica membranes were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermal gravimetery analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. These methods confirmed the homogenous and nano scale distribution of silica nanoparticles in prepared polymers. Gas permeation properties of polyurethane-silica nanocomposite membranes with silica content of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 wt.% was studied for pure CO2, CH4, N2 and O2 gases. The obtained results indicated the reduction in permeability of all gases, but enhancement in CO2 / N2, CO2 / CH4 and O2 / N2 selectivities was observed by increasing the content of non-permeable silica nanoparticles in polyurethane-silica membranes. In the case of polyurethane-silica (20 wt.% ) nanocomposite membrane, the obtained CO2 / N2 selectivity was 1.65 times of pure polyurethane, while the CO2 permeability reduction of polyurethane-silica membranes was 35.6% in comparison with pure polyurethane. Finally, the modified Higuchi model was applied to predict the permeability of polyurethane-silica membranes and fairly good agreement was observed between experimental and predicted gas permeabilities of these membranes.

925,Gas separation properties of polyether-based polyurethane–silica nanocomposite membranes.xml,['Introduction']," As stated in literature, presence and proper distribution of silica nanoparticles in polymer matrix increase the mechanical strength and thermal stability of polymers [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Such unique properties of these materials have led to the increasing use of this material in the preparation of polymeric membranes [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. Moaddeb and Koros [9] investigated the effect of silica particles on the gas separation properties of high performance polyimides. They showed that, incorporation of silica particles into the polymer matrix mainly improved the gas separation properties of polymer-silica membranes, especially in the case of O2 / N2 separation. The main observed improvements were the attainment of high O2 / N2 selectivity and O2 permeability of some silica-polymer hybrids, simultaneously. Therefore, O2 / N2 separation properties of some silica-polymer membranes were above the Robeson's upper bound line, while that of the pure polymer was below the Robeson's upper bound line [9]. This upper bound was expressed as a line on a log-log plot of separation factor versus permeability of the more permeable gas above which virtually no data exists. Kusakabe et al. [10] and Joly et al. [11] also studied the effect of silica particles on the CO2 permeation of silica-polyimide composite membranes. The obtained results by Kusakabe et al. showed that, in the presence of silica in the polymer matrix, the CO2 permeability of composite membranes can increase up to 10 times of that of the pure polymer [10]. The experimental results obtained by Joly et al. showed 50-100% increase in gas solubility of membranes composed of silica in comparison with the pure polyimide. They characterized the composite membranes and verified the reduction in polymer compaction by silica content, and thus the increase in the gas solubility of membranes in the presence of silica particles [11]. Nunes et al. [12] investigated the effect of the distribution of silica nanoparticles on the separation performance of polyetherimide membranes. Silica particles were prepared via in situ polymerization of organic compounds and hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate, simultaneously. Amino silicate was used as a compatible agent between organic and inorganic phases. The durability of hybrid membranes was also investigated for methane, butane and pentane gases at 80 bar. The obtained results by Nunes et al. showed that the gas permeability reduction in the presence of silica particles in the polymer matrix was only 10% , while, under the same condition, permeability of pure polymer dropped 60% during the durability test [12]. Other researchers like Smaihi et al. [13], Cornelius and Marand [14], Park et al. [15] and recently Boroglua and Gurkaynak [16] also investigated the effect of silica particles on the gas separation (permeation) properties of polyimide-silica membranes.Some other researchers studied the effect of silica particles on the separation performance of other polymers. Kim et al. [17] studied the gas transport properties of poly (amide-6-b-ethylene oxide) (PEBAX) in the presence of silica. They revealed that the presence of silica in the polymer matrix had an important influence on the membrane morphology and this effect led to favorable changes in the permeation properties of obtained membranes. Kim et al. reported that in the presence of silica, the degree of crystallinity of PA section markedly decreases. Therefore, the percentage of the amorphous phase of PEBAX increases and the permeabilities of gases also increase with silica content, as it was observed experimentally. The results of gas absorption in the composite membranes showed an increased uptake with increasing the amount of silica in the membranes. Kim et al. introduced two factors for such an increase in the absorption of gases in composite membranes containing silica:-The obtained changes in the morphology of interface between silica and PA and PEO segments, and ultimately increase in the percentage of the amorphous region in the composite membrane.-Interaction of additional OH groups of silica with polar molecules like CO2. The obtained changes in the morphology of interface between silica and PA and PEO segments, and ultimately increase in the percentage of the amorphous region in the composite membrane. Interaction of additional OH groups of silica with polar molecules like CO2. Chen et al. [18], [19] used in situ polymerization of silica nanoparticles in the preparation of polyether-based polyurethane / silica nanocomposites. First, silica nanoparticles were added to the polyether polyol by in situ polymerization and then polymerization reaction was completed by isophoronediisocyanate (IPDI). Based on the obtained FTIR spectra and TGA thermograms, it was shown that in the case of in situ polymerization method, silica and polyether segments interact more than that of simple blending method. This phenomenon further increases the glass transition temperature of hybrid polymers and also the homogeneous distribution of silica nanoparticles in the polymer. The obtained results also showed that the mechanical and physical properties of polyurethane-silica hybrids in the presence of silica particles with 28 nm size were the optimum. In addition, polyurethane-silica hybrids produced by the method of in situ polymerization had better mechanical properties than those made by simple blending method [18], [19]. Chen et al. [20], also investigated the effect of silica nanoparticles on the mechanical and thermal properties of polyether based polyurethane prepared by in situ polymerization. The obtained results showed that adding silica nanoparticles into the polymer improved the hardness, glass transition temperature and adhesion between different layers of polyurethane, however, increased the resin viscosity. Recently, the authors investigated the effect of silica nanoparticles on the gas separation properties of PBI and EVA membranes [21], [22]. As shown, the solubility of the CO2, CH4 and N2 gases in the membranes increased by increasing the silica content in the polymer matrix, whereas diffusivity of gases decreased. The resultant effect of silica addition to PBI was CO2 / N2 selectivity increment due to increase in CO2 permeability and reduction in noncondensable N2 gas permeability [21]. The obtained results showed the enhancement in gas permeation and selectivity of CO2 / N2 and CO2 / CH4 pair gases in the case of EVA / silica nanocomposites. The authors have also published their studies on polyurethane membranes in literature and investigated the effects of hard segments, the chain extender length and the effects of urethane and urea content on the gas permeation properties of polyurethane and polyurethane urea membranes [31], [32], [33]. Studies in the field of adding silica particles into the polyurethanes, has mainly focused on the physical and mechanical behavior of these polymers [8], [18], [19], [20], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Up to date, there are rare reports about adding silica particles into the polyurethane and its effect on gas permeation properties of these polymers in the literature [30]. Therefore, in the present study, the gas permeation properties of polyurethane-silica nanocomposite membranes were investigated. In this regard, silica nanoparticles have been prepared using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in the sol-gel process and applied to modify the structure of the polyurethane membranes and improve their gas permeation properties. The permeability of CH4, CO2, O2 and N2 gases were obtained at various silica contents. Also the permeation behavior of the nanocomposite membranes has been modeled by modified Higuchi model and the new coefficient for studied gases was suggested for this model. "

935,Gas separation properties of polyether-based polyurethane–silica nanocomposite membranes.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'FTIR analysis']"," Structural characteristic of pure silicate, polyurethane and nanocomposite polyether-based polyurethane-silica hybrid membranes were carried out using FTIR analysis. The FTIR spectra of prepared composite membranes were shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the asymmetric vibration Si-O-Si peak at 1077 cm^-1 is easily observed in all nanocomposite membranes. The peaks related to the oscillatory vibrations of Si-O-Si at 453 cm^-1 and symmetrical vibrations of Si-O-Si at 795 cm^-1 in the composite membranes are also well observed. More inspection of the effects of silica nanoparticles on the phase separation of hard and soft segments of prepared membranes will follow by the presentation of the peaks related to the carbonyl groups. Fig. 2 shows the absorption of urethane carbonyl groups in pure polymer and hybrid membranes. The peak appeared in lower frequency (around 1682 cm^-1) refers to the bonded and the one appeared in higher frequency (around 1718 cm^-1) refers to the free carbonyls. As it was shown in Fig. 2, the free carbonyl peak slowly shifts toward the hydrogen-bonded carbonyl bond and finally removed by increasing silica content. This observation indicates more hydrogen bonding between urethane carbonyl groups and urethane N-H groups in hard segments. It can be deducted that a portion of the silica nanoparticles is able to distribute in soft segments of the polymer by interaction of OH groups in silica with ether groups of polyol in polyurethane. Therefore, the amount of available ethereal pieces of soft segments groups to create hydrogen bond with the N-H groups reduces and hence urethane N-H groups interact more with carbonyl groups of hard segments of urethane. So it may be concluded that the silica particles could distribute in the polymer chains by introduction of the good interaction between their OH groups and ether groups in the soft segments of urethane.

Fig. 4 shows the DSC thermograms of prepared samples. There is a Tg transition around-60 °C which is related to the glass transition temperature of soft segments. Also, there are two Tm peaks; a wide Tm peak in the range of 120-170 °C and a small Tm peak at 50-60 °C; respected to the hard segment crystallinity. Polypropylene glycol due to its vicinity on regularity could not crystalline anymore, so the crystallization peak which is appeared on the high temperature range of 120-170 °C and small Tm peak at 50-60 °C would only respect to crystallization of hard segments. The crystalline peak appeared in the range of 50-60 may respect to hard segments which are connected to the soft segments. Due to higher molecular mobility of the soft segments, this Tm appeared at lower temperatures. The wide endothermic peak of crystalline structure of hard segments is due to distributed nature of the hard segments in polymer. The presence of the crystalline peak of hard segments also shows the high phase separation of hard and soft segments. As shown in Fig. 4, the glass transition temperatures of polymers are less than zero and are associated with polyol that is not changed after the arrival of silica. This phenomenon indicates no change in the dynamic of polyol chains in the presence of silica nanoparticles in polymers. According to the abovementioned FTIR test results, and because of the hydrogen bonding between silica and polyol chains, a decrease in the mobility of chains was expected. But any changes in the mobility of polyol chains in the presence of silica have been occurred, it would respect to the reduction in the amount of hydrogen bonding between hard and soft segments of the polymer. By addition the silica particles into the polymer, the bonding between polymer chains and silica occurred and also the amount of hydrogen bonding between polyol and hard segment decreases. Based on the FTIR spectra, the amount of physical bonding between hard and soft segments of polymer in the absence of silica particles in the polymer is more than that of silica particles distribution in the polymer. Therefore, it can be concluded that in the presence of silica, hydrogen bonding between hard and soft segments of polymer is replaced by hydrogen bonding between silica particles and polyol chains and total chain mobility of polyol will not change significantly. Also it can be seen in Fig. 4 that by increasing the silica particles in the polymer, the slope of the glass transition state decreases. Decrease in slope of the glass transition state indicates that silica particles and polyol interact with each other that lead to wide transition. Fig. 4 also shows that by increasing the silica particles the crystalline peak of hard segments do not change remarkably. It concludes that most of the silica particles distributed in soft segment domains. Thermal stability of polyurethane-silica composite membranes was studied using TGA. Fig. 5 shows the weight reduction of prepared composite membranes with temperature. As seen, the decomposition of polyether-based polyurethane membranes starts from 350 °C, and up to 450 °C, 90 to 95% of the weight of polymer in each sample decreases. Two different slopes of reduction were observed in this region. These two different slopes show that there are two different weight reductions in prepared polymers. First one is related to the breakage in urethane bonds, while the second step is related to the thermal decomposition of polyol [35]. As shown in Fig. 5, in the case of nanocomposite membranes, the slope of weight reduction decreases by increasing the amount of silica in the polymer. Based on this phenomenon it can be concluded that the thermal stability of the polymer increases by addition of silica nanoparticles into the polymer. Presented results in Fig. 5 also show that the remaining membrane weight after applying heating up to 800 °C is consistent with the theoretical silica weight percentage of nanocomposite membranes. This could be a good reason for fully entrance of silica nanoparticles into the polymer during membrane preparation. It should be noted that the remaining weights after heating up to 800 °C were 1.11% , 2.9% , 5.81% , 11% and 21.5% for pure polymer, and nanocomposite membranes containing 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 wt.% of silica, respectively.

943,Gas separation properties of polyether-based polyurethane–silica nanocomposite membranes.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Gas permeation properties of polyurethane–silica membranes']"," Fig. 6 shows the effect of silica nanoparticles on the gas permeability of polyurethane-silica membranes. As shown in this figure, the permeability of CO2 is significantly higher than those of other gases in all pure and composite membranes. As described before, the high permeation rate of CO2 in comparison with other studied gases is due to its low kinetic diameter, high condensability and more interaction of this polar gas with polar groups in polymer [32], [34]. As shown in Fig. 6, the permeability of methane is higher than those of oxygen and nitrogen in spite of its higher molecular size. The higher permeability of methane in comparison with oxygen and nitrogen could be acceptable because of its higher condensability. As known, the solution mechanism is dominant in permeation of gases through rubbery polymers. Therefore, the obtained results would show the high rubbery properties of pure and composite membranes. Fig. 6 also shows the gas permeability of membranes reduces by increasing the amount of silica nanoparticles in polymer. It is suggested in polyurethane membranes that soft segment domains are formed as a result of a microphase separation and permeable to molecules, whereas the hard segment domains act as an impermeable barrier. Although the hard segment domains are not expected to be accessible to permeating molecules, they can influence the overall gas transport properties of a polymer due to their ability to serve physical crosslinks and change the dynamics of the soft segments [32]. In the case of polyurethane-silica composite membrane, there are two hard and soft segment regions for distribution of silica nanoparticles. From entropic point of view it appears that silica nanoparticles prefer to distribute in the hard segment of polyurethane [36], [37]. The presence of silica particles in the hard phase can help the formation of crystals in the polymer [36]. It can also prevent the formation of crystals by disturbing the regularity and density of the nearby chains and reduce the amount of crystallinity of the polymer [24]. As shown in the DSC results, no significant difference between the crystallinity of polyurethane before and after addition of silica nanoparticles was observed. However, FTIR results showed that the probability of distribution of particles in the soft phase exists. The gas permeability test results (Fig. 6) also showed that gas permeability in all prepared composite membranes decreased with increasing the amount of silica nanoparticles. Therefore, based on the abovementioned results, it would be concluded that the most population of silica nanoparticles is distributed in the soft phase. As mentioned above, the soft segments are permeable domains in polyurethane membranes. Though, distribution of these particles in the soft phase due to the impermeability properties of silica particles reduces the permeation of gases in polymer. So, gas permeability reduction can be attributed to the presence of silica particles in the soft segment regions and restriction of molecular passing direction and creation a meander path to pass through. Soft and flexible polyol segments of polyurethane, alone have the necessary flexibility and movement to create space for movement of gas molecules. The presence of additional substances such as nonpermeable silica particles reduces the free volume of soft segments and reduces the passage areas of gas molecules. It should be noted that in the case of glassy polymers, the presence of spherical particles sometimes causes the extra voids between polymer chains and prevent the chain compression [18]. Comparison of gas permeability in polyurethane and polyurethane-silica composites (as shown in Fig. 6) shows that the gas permeabilities of carbon dioxide, methane, oxygen and nitrogen in the pure polymer decrease from 186.47, 19.5, 16.26 and 7.47 barrer to the amount of 120, 8.632, 7.69 and 2.98 barrer in the polyurethane-silica (20 wt.% ) composite membrane, respectively. Calculated reduction values of gas permeability of prepared nanocomposite membranes in respect to pure polyurethane are in the following order:CO2 (35.6% ) < O2 (52.7% ) < CH4 (54.19% ) < N2 (60.1% ) By reducing the amount of free volume of the polymer, the gas molecules with larger size are more restricted for crossing the polymer thickness than smaller ones and thus their permeabilities will decrease more [32]. Therefore, higher reduction of N2 permeability in comparison with CO2 and O2 is due to its large molecular size and because of the presence of silica nanoparticles, is acceptable. In contrary to that of N2, less reduction in permeability of methane gas, with larger molecular size than nitrogen, was observed. The main reason attributes to more condensability of methane in the membrane. The presence of silica nanoparticles due to its non-organic nature would create some special spaces in the interface of organic polymer and non-organic particles which are suitable for dissolution of condensable gases. Also, FTIR spectra of polyurethane-silica samples showed that in addition to introduction of SiO2 groups, some OH groups will enter the membrane. The presences of these groups in polymer structure provide appropriate positions for the dissolution of gases. Thus, by increasing the content of silica in polymer, solution of condensable methane gas will increase, and in spite of its larger molecular size than N2, its permeability decreases slower. In the case of carbon dioxide, its lower permeability reduction with increasing silica compared to other gases is due to both its small molecular size and also it's more dissolution in the membrane due to the increased polar OH groups in the polymer with increasing silica content. Good interaction between polar carbon dioxide and polar OH groups in silica increases the dissolution of CO2 in the polymer. Fig. 7 shows the CO2 / N2, CO2 / CH4 and O2 / N2 permselectivities of polyurethane-silica nanocomposite membranes. As it can be seen, by increasing the silica content in nanocomposites, all permselectivities increased. Fig. 7 shows that CO2 / N2, CO2 / CH4 and O2 / N2 permselectivities increase from 24.96, 9.56 and 2.17 for pure polyurethane to 41.26, 13.43 and 2.58 for polyurethane-silica (20 wt.% ). Comparative increase in permselectivity of pair gases shows that the increase in CO2 / N2, CO2 / CH4, O2 / N2 permselectivities are 65.3% , 40.5% and 18.9% , respectively. As known in solution-diffusion mechanism of permeation of gases through polymeric membranes, the permselectivity of a pair gas is composed of solubility selectivity and diffusivity selectivity of the gases in membrane. By addition of the silica nanoparticles into the membranes, as mentioned, the permeation of larger molecular size gases restricted more than that of smaller one [32]. It offers the more molecular sieve property of composite membranes by increasing the silica in them. Though, the better molecular sieve property of composite membranes offers the enhancement in permselectivity of CO2 / N2, CO2 / CH4 and O2 / N2 gases in nanocomposite membranes. In the case of O2 / N2, because the condensabilities of these two gases are very low and not very different, the molecular size difference in this pair of gases plays an important role. Therefore, the improvement of diffusivity selectivity due to better molecular sieve property of nanocomposite membranes, only cause the selectivity increment and finally the total selectivity increment is not very high. But in the case of CO2 / N2 and CO2 / CH4 gases because of more condensable property and also more interaction of CO2 in comparison with methane and nitrogen, the solubility selectivity also has effective role on enhancement of permselectivity of pair gases. Therefore, the enhancements in CO2 / N2 and CO2 / CH4 selectivities are significantly more than that of O2 / N2 selectivity. Finally, the more increasing of CO2 / N2 selectivity in comparison with CO2 / CH4, is attributed to very low condensability of nitrogen in comparison with methane. As mentioned, the suitable sorption sites on polymer-silica interface offer more solubility of condensable gases and solution of methane due to its condensable nature which is significantly more than that of nitrogen. Therefore, in spite of higher molecular size of the methane which could offer higher diffusivity selectivity of CO2 / CH4 in comparison with CO2 / N2, domination of solution mechanism causes the high solution of methane and lowers the solubility selectivity. As stated by other researchers, for commercial and industrial use of membranes in gas separation processes, membranes must have a maximum amount of permeability and selectivity. The obtained results from prepared polyurethane-silica membranes were compared with Robeson's upper bound line [38] in Fig. 8. As shown, the prepared polyurethane-silica membranes lay close to Robeson's upper bound line and this means prepared nanocomposite membranes present better CO2 / N2 separation performance than other PU membranes. The variation of nanocomposite membranes, in spite of their lower permeability, shows better performance because of their better selectivity. "

As it was stated in our previous publication [21], Eq. (4) predicts the gas permeability of hybrid membranes in the presence of impermeable material like silica particles:(4)PeffPc=16Φ4+2Φ-KH(1-Φ)The Higuchi constant, KH, was selected 0.78 by Higuchi for the best fit of the experimental data to model [39]. In our previous work we tried to fit the Higuchi model for predicting the gas permeability of PBI-silica hybrid membranes. As evaluated in PBI-silica nanocomposite membranes the Higuchi constant should change to higher values to fit the Higuchi model to experimental data. The KH constant establishes the effect of filler in membrane. We suggested by decreasing the size of the particles to nanoscale size the impression of particles would increase and the Higuchi constant would be modified. We established that KH = 3.7 shows the best fit of N2 permeation data to Higuchi model [21]. In the case of PU-silica nanocomposite membranes, the Higuchi model fitted to experimental data and the appropriate KH constants extracted for CO2, N2, CH4 and O2 gases (Table 2). As presented in Table 2, KH increases as the molecular size of the gases increase, except in the case of nitrogen and methane which may refer to the higher condensability of methane. The order of KH is in good agreement with the order of reduction values of gas permeability of prepared nanocomposite membranes in respect to pure polyurethane.Higuchi constant:CO2 (2.6) < O2 (3.35) < CH4 (3.45) < N2 (3.58)Reduction value of gas permeability:CO2 (35.6% ) < O2 (52.7% ) < CH4 (54.19% ) < N2 (60.1% ) Higuchi constant:CO2 (2.6) < O2 (3.35) < CH4 (3.45) < N2 (3.58) Reduction value of gas permeability:CO2 (35.6% ) < O2 (52.7% ) < CH4 (54.19% ) < N2 (60.1% ) It would be concluded that by increasing the effect of nanoparticles in membranes, the Higuchi constant would increase.

950,Gas separation properties of polyether-based polyurethane–silica nanocomposite membranes.xml,['Conclusions']," In this study, the effect of silica nanoparticles on the gas permeation properties of polyether-based polyurethane-silica membranes was investigated. In this regard, polyurethane was synthesized by bulk two-step polymerization method. Polypropylene glycol was incubated with HMDI under nitrogen atmosphere to obtain macrodiisocyanate prepolymer. The chain extension of prepolymers was performed by addition of BDO at room temperature. Silica nanoparticles were prepared through the sol-gel method by hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). Therefore, polyurethane-silica nanocomposite membranes were prepared by solution blending and casting method. The prepared polyurethane-silica membranes were characterized using FTIR, SEM and DSC methods. FTIR and SEM results verified the presence of silica nanoparticles in the prepared samples. The gas permeation properties of prepared nanocomposite membranes also showed the decrease in gas permeability of membranes with silica content, but increase in CO2 / N2 and CO2 / CH4 selectivities. The permeation of gases also modeled by modified Higuchi model. The new constants for Higuchi model obtained for studied gases. The experimental data and modified model showed good agreement. "

952,Gas transfer properties of wheat gluten coated paper adapted to eMAP of fresh parsley.xml,['abstract']," Gas transfer properties of wheat gluten (WG) coated paper and their ability to fulfil the requirements in eMAP of fresh parsley were studied. Permeation of gases through WG-paper was demonstrated to be RH-dependent and closely related to structural modification in the WG layer. Formation of micro-cracks was evidenced in dry conditions; but when increasing RH, plasticisation occurs within the protein layer and micro-fractures were reduced until disappearance. This reversible phenomenon allowed the WG-layer to recover its integrity at RH higher than 70% , and the WG character to be expressed in such conditions. When used at 20 °C and 80% RH as part of the packaging of parsley, modified atmosphere was created and a steady state of 11 kPa O2 and 4.5 kPa CO2 was reached after 45 h. In such conditions, the overall quality of parsley leaves remained acceptable during 8 days, with only 28% loss of chlorophyll. "

957,Gas transfer properties of wheat gluten coated paper adapted to eMAP of fresh parsley.xml,['Introduction']," Preservation of both organoleptic properties and nutritional value of fresh culinary herbs still constitutes a challenging application for the food industry. Chill temperature, between 0 and 5 °C, is recommended to the storage of most of them: shelf life of parsley was extended from 3 days (Lisiewska and Kmiecik, 1997) to up to 2 month (UC Davis, 2002) when lowering temperature from 20 to 0 °C. But, whether such a low temperature range is easily obtained in storage room, it is difficult to ensure all along the global distribution chain due to poor handling and management practices that still occur (e.g. during transport and retailing). As a consequence temperature abuse is inevitable. This is detrimental to produce quality, leading to high wastage, and even worse, to safety as previously reported by Naimi et al. (2003) regarding outbreaks partially caused by improper storage temperature of parsley. Aside better chill chain management and control, other alternatives for extending shelf life of fresh culinary herb at ambient temperature should be explored. Among them, equilibrium modified Atmosphere Packaging (eMAP) could be considered since it is already commonly applied to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetable by replacing normal air by appropriate gas (oxygen and carbon dioxide) composition. It relies on the natural interplay between gas consumption (O2) and production (CO2) by the respiring food and gas permeation through the packaging material. After a transient period, a steady gas composition is reached, that should be close to the recommended one. In the case of parsley, no unique combination has been identified but the level of O2 appeared to have minor effect than CO2: 10% CO2 combined with either 10% O2 (Yamauchi and Watada, 1993) or 21% O2 (Lers et al., 1998) delays colour loss at ambient temperature (20-25 °C). Even with small amount of CO2 (0.5% ), beneficial effect on colour was observed when compares to air (Apeland, 1971). It also reduces respiration rate as demonstrated with 10% CO2 at 25 °C (Lers et al., 1998) on parsley. With high to very high barrier properties, conventional plastics need micro to macro-perforations for increasing O2 permeation rate in order to avoid anoxia, mainly when used for produce with high respiration rates as identified in parsley (Apeland, 1971). However, protein-based materials exhibit original gas transfer properties that also suit to fresh produce: low gas permeation in dry conditions but high permeation rates in high relative humidity (RH) conditions as evidenced in wheat gluten-based materials (Gontard et al., 1996, MujicaPaz and Gontard, 1997, Pochat-Bohatier et al., 2006). In addition, they get a strong eco-friendly character since directly extracted from food industry by-products as wheat gluten proteins, renewable, and biodegradable (Averous, 2004, Gandini, 2008, Sorrentino et al., 2007). Their ability to fit the requirements in eMAP of fresh fruits and vegetables (where RH quickly increased) has been previously demonstrated on mushrooms (Barron et al., 2002) or strawberries (Tanada-Palmu and Grosso, 2005). But, drawback is their water-sensitive mechanical properties that must be improved prior to be considered as an alternative route to perforated plastics. One of the strategies consists in coating proteins onto paper support, making the most of functional properties of proteins and mechanical resistance of the paper as previously reported for whey proteins (Gallstedt et al., 2005, Han and Krochta, 1999, Han and Krochta, 2001), corn zein (Trezza and Vergano, 1994, Trezza et al., 1998), soy proteins (Ben Arfa et al., 2007, Chalier et al., 2009, Park et al., 2000), and wheat gluten (WG) proteins (Cagnon et al., 2012, Gallstedt et al., 2005, Guillaume et al., 2010). Whether surface properties of proteins coated paper, as grease resistance or moisture absorption, remain roughly the same as the self-supported protein (Guillaume et al., 2010, Park et al., 2000, Trezza and Vergano, 1994), gas transfer properties become in-between the ones of paper and proteins (Gallstedt et al., 2005, Guillaume et al., 2010, Trezza et al., 1998). This is attributed to the additivity of gas transfer resistance through each layer of the coated material, nevertheless governs by the most resistive (or barrier) layer if its integrity is ensured. Protein coated papers can be considered as a three-layers material consisted in protein, paper, and a composite (or impregnation) zone where protein penetrates paper fibres as evidenced in wheat gluten-coated papers (Cagnon et al., 2013). Being the most resistive layer, the thickness together with the coating weight of coated-proteins is of importance in the expression of the protein-like gas transfer properties. However, the thickness of the composite zone (or level of impregnation) was demonstrated to also affect it in wheat gluten-coated papers: when sufficiently thick, it acts as a tension absorber to limit the disruption of the protein layer (Guillaume et al., 2010). This was only confirmed at one RH (80% ). The present study aims to go deeper in the understanding of the expression of wheat gluten (WG)-like gas transfer properties in highly impregnated WG coated papers, so called WG-papers, and their ability to induce modified atmosphere when used as a component of packaging for fresh parsley. O2 and CO2 permeation were studied in different RH conditions and related to the structure of the WG-paper. Then effect of mass transfer properties of WG-paper on the establishment of a steady modified atmosphere and food quality was assessed at 20 °C, to simulate ambient temperature, and compared to support paper.

959,Gas transfer properties of wheat gluten coated paper adapted to eMAP of fresh parsley.xml,"['Material and methods', 'Preparation of WG-papers']"," WG-coating solution was prepared at room temperature, according to a two-step procedure (Morel et al., 2000), slightly adapted to obtain free alcohol solutions. Firstly, 20 g of wheat gluten powder was poured into a hermetic box and dispersed, under shaking, in 50 mL of deionised water containing sodium sulphite (0.08 g 100 mL^-1) as a reducing agent of disulphide bonds. After 30 min of settling, the solution was adjusted to 100 mL by slowly adding deionised water containing acetic acid (ratio 1:1) to reach a pH value of 4, under magnetic stirring. Prior to coating, paper was wet and then, flattened under vacuum on a leveled aluminium plate to be stuck at the edges using masking tape. This avoided wrinkling during the coating process. Thereafter, vacuum was stopped and a layer (about 150 μm-thick) was coated onto paper, using a thin-layer chromatography applicator (Braive instruments, Liege, Belgium), to produce WG coated paper, hereinafter referred as WG-paper. Drying was performed at 25 °C and 50% RH until constant weight. Final thickness of WG-papers was 73.5±4.0 μm (against 60.5±1.7 μm for uncoated paper), their coating weight was 20.7±2.2 g protein m^-2, and percentage of impregnation was 61% . Materials were stored in ambient condition for surface observations or at 20 °C and 80% RH into a climatic incubator (Meditest 600, Firlabo, France) during 4 days prior to MAP experiments. For gas permeation measurements at 20 °C, materials were placed in a permeation cell for conditioning at the desired relative humidity and for desorbing O2. The method used was the same as described below (see Section 2.3) except that the upper and lower chambers were both spread by a 40 mL min^-1 flux of humidified carrier gas (He) until no O2 was detected (around 24 h).

Materials were placed in a permeation cell, i.e. between two stainless steel chambers. The inferior and superior chambers were each spread by a 40 mL min^-1 flux of permeant (O2 or CO2) and carrier gas (He), respectively. The permeability cell was coupled to a gas chromatograph (GC 3800, VARIAN, Les Ulis, France) which allowed to online analyse the evolution with time of permeant gas concentration in the superior chamber of the cell thanks to an automatic valve. Gas chromatograph was equipped with a filled column (Porapak Q, Chrompak) of 2 m length and 0.32 m diameter for separating O2 and CO2, a thermal conductibility detector (TCD) and automatic injector. A minimum of three replicates for each material and each permeant were measured. The measured gas (O2 or CO2) permeability of the film was determined as following in the international system units:(1)Px=ΔQ×eΔt×A×(p2-p1)where subscript x refers to O2 or CO2 permeability, ΔQ is the quantity of gas that pass through the film, e is the thickness of material, Δt is the time for which permeation occurs, A is the film area exposed and (p2-p1) is the difference in pressure exerted by the gas on each side of the film. Gas permeability (Px) as then expressed in 10^-18 mol m^-1 s^-1 Pa^-1 unit. To set moisture conditions, both permeant and carrier gas were humidified by bubbling in a wash flask that contained ultra-pure water and was placed in a cryothermostat regulated at a properly chosen temperature. The differential of temperature imposed between the cryothermostat and the permeation cell (fixed at 20 °C) permitted the establishment of the desired relative humidity in the permeation cell. Dry conditions were obtained by shutting wash flasks. "

A special system allow to hermetically fix the sampled material onto the jar, and gas transfers only occur through it, with a diffusion area of 0.0053 m^2.

The angle between the camera lens axis and the light source axis was around 45 °. A digital camera (DSC-S75, Sony) recorded images on an electric light sensor made up of 3.3 millions pixels with a resolution of 1.600 × 1.200 pixels. The camera was at a distance of 8 cm from the sample and macro was used. By connecting the camera to the USB port of a computer, images were captured for colour analysis. Parts of interest of images were selected with Photoshop software version 5.2 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, Calif.) and its selection tool “Rectangular Marquee”. The area of the region of interest was defined as the number of pixels contained within its boundary (Du and Sun, 2004). The histogram window of the software provided parameters values for lightness (or luminance) and the two chromatic components a, from green to red, and b, from blue to yellow. Since this software uses 256 levels (from 0 to 255) to characterise these parameters on each pixel, the following equation was used to convert them into the L^*a^*b^* CIE parameters (Yam and Papadakis, 2004) in which L^* range from 0 to 100 (Eq.

Same experiment was also conducted on uncoated paper but it exhibited a too high gas permeation that exceeded 1, 732, 000 × 10^-18 mol m^-1 Pa^-1 s^-1, whatever the RH and the studied gas. This was due to the presence of leaks and channels in such a porous material, for which permeation is actually diffusion of gas through air. Gas permeability of WG-paper increased when RH rose from 70% to 90% : value of 2220-8512 × 10^-18 mol m^-1 Pa^-1 s^-1 for O2 and 1840-67,790 × 10^-18 mol m^-1 Pa^-1 s^-1 for CO2, respectively (Fig. 1). This RH-induced effect was also observed in WG-films (self-supported materials) and was attributed to an increase in the mobility of polymeric chains, related to a structural change from a glassy to a rubbery state caused by water uptake in high RH conditions (Cuq et al., 1997, Gontard and Ring, 1996, Gontard et al., 1996). As in WG-film, when increasing RH from 70% to 90% , the raise in gas permeability of WG-paper appeared more pronounced for CO2 than O2 (36.8-against 3.8-fold, respectively). It should be explained by the higher water solubility of CO2 compared to O2 (SO2 = 1.25 and SCO2 = 34.5 mmol L^-1; S: solubility at 25 °C and 1 atm) and also by a selective sorption of CO2. Specific interactions should set up between CO2 and chemical groups of amino-acid, most of all, amide groups are mainly represented in wheat gluten proteins (Pochat-Bohatier et al., 2006). At high RH, sorption of water would provide a better CO2 accessibility to these sites onto a mobile polymeric chain, then favouring CO2 sorption. As a consequence, permselectivity was highly affected by RH and rose from 1 at 70% to 8 at 90% RH (Fig. 1), indicating that the unique permselectivity properties of WG-network was preserved when combined with paper. It should be noted that the RH effect was more important when passing from 80% to 90% RH than from 70% to 80% , as previously observed on WG-film (Gontard et al., 1996, MujicaPaz and Gontard, 1997). This can be correlated to water vapour sorption phenomenon. Due to its hydrophilic nature, water sorption curve of WG-film exhibited an exponential shape and sharply increased when water activity value reach 0.7 (Guillard et al., 2003, Pochat-Bohatier et al., 2006). Albeit the change in permselectivity of WG-paper was similar to that of WG-film, the quantitative variation was less significant: permselectivity of WG-film increased from 9 to 20 in the same RH range, from 70% to 90% (Gontard et al., 1996). When manufacturing self-supported material, it is necessary to add plasticizer, as glycerol, in the WG-solution to improve mechanical properties of the resulting WG-film (Gontard et al., 1993). This plasticizing agent favours water uptake in high RH condition and consequently swelling and mobility of the polymeric chains. Then, water uptake might be higher in WG-film, containing glycerol, than in the WG-coated layer, devoid of it, as previously showed on WG-coated Condat paper (Chalier et al., 2007). By this way, unfolding of proteins and exposure of CO2 binding sites at high RH would be easier in WG-film than in WG-layer coated onto paper support. Another point is that in WG-paper, part of the proteins may interpenetrate cellulosic fibres, suggesting a composite like structure (Guillaume et al., 2010). In this junction zone, mobility of proteins should be reduced and, consequently, the CO2 accessibility to its binding site. Whatever, at 90% RH, the permselectivity of WG-paper remained higher than that encountered in most of plastic films used to pack fresh fruit and vegetable: between 1 for micro-perforated materials and 4 for low density polyethylene LDPE (Al-Ati and Hotchkiss, 2003, Charles et al., 2003). In dry conditions, WG-paper exhibited gas permeability values 14-fold higher than those obtained at 70% RH: 31,315 and 27,242 × 10^-18 mol m^-1 Pa^-1 s^-1 for O2 and CO2, respectively (Fig. 1). By using compression-moulding process, Gallstedt et al., 2005, obtained WG paper with O2 permeability of about 2160 × 10^-18 mol m^-1 Pa^-1 s^-1 at 0% RH; but, WG-film showed excellent barrier properties in same conditions: 1.24 × 10^-18 mol m^-1 Pa^-1 s^-1 and 7.4 × 10^-18 mol m^-1 Pa^-1 s^-1 for O2 and CO2 permeability, respectively (Gontard et al., 1996). Whatever the process used to obtain WG-paper, WG-layer seemed to loose its barrier effect when combined with paper, in dry condition. This was attributed to structural modifications in the coated layer during RH changes as indicated by ESEM observations (Fig. 2). At 0% RH, micrograph revealed micro-fractures onto the material surface (Fig. 2A) that were reduced as humidity increased, up (e.g. 40% RH in Fig. 2B) to a free-defect surface observed at 98% RH (Fig. 2C). This does not occur in self-supported films where the plasticizing agent considerably improves the elasticity of the film and prevent it from cracking even at low RH (Gontard et al., 1993). The phenomenon identified in WG-paper was reversible since micro-fractures re-appeared while decreasing RH. It should be stressed that these micro-fractures were at least 1000 fold smaller (shorter, tighter and less deep) than cracks previously evidenced at the surface of WG-paper obtained by coating onto surface-treated paper (Guillaume et al., 2010). Then, they probably did not disrupt the integrity of the overall junction zone, where proteins interpenetrate the cellulosic fibres. In dry conditions, WG-paper was highly permeable to gases and non-selective because of micro-fractures evidenced at its surface. Conversely, in high RH conditions, plasticisation occurs increasing the protein chains mobility within the coated layer and leads to disappearance of micro-fractures. Consequently, high RH allowed the WG-layer to recover its integrity and permselectivity. In such conditions, packaging application can be envisaged to preserve produce with high moisture content, as it is the case of fresh herbs. "

973,Gas transfer properties of wheat gluten coated paper adapted to eMAP of fresh parsley.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'WG paper as MAP for parsley leaves: change in gas composition and weight loss']"," WG-paper and uncoated paper were tested as passive MAP materials for fresh parsley leaves. Partial pressures of O2 and CO2 in the headspace were monitored during storage at 20 °C and 80% RH; results are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, O2 content decreased while CO2 increased during a transient period, in which gas permeation through the material did not compensate O2 consumption and CO2 production by the produce (Kader et al., 1989). Then, a steady state was reached, when respiration of the produce was balanced by gas permeation through the material. The headspace equilibrium quickly appeared when using the uncoated paper, almost 9 h after conditioning, with values of about 19 kPa for O2 and 1 kPa for CO2. This composition was so close to air (20.62±1.21 kPa for O2 and 0.80±0.69 kPa for CO2, according to Fonseca et al., 2000) that it cannot be considered as a modified atmosphere. Since it was highly porous, uncoated paper behaved as macro-perforated synthetic materials: air permeation was too high to allow the establishment of a modified atmosphere. The use of WG-paper led to a longer transient period of 45 h marked by the formation of a CO2 peak (around 6 kPa, after 24 h of packing), to finally reached a steady state of 11 kPa O2 and 4.5 kPa CO2 (Fig. 3). The long duration of the transient period (almost 2 days) was attributed to the large free volume imposed by the condition of the experiment. Maintaining the same breathable area (as a window) in a packaging with lower free volume, the transient period would be considerably reduced without affecting either steady conditions or the formation of CO2 peak, as previously evidenced (Fishman et al., 1995). The appearance of a CO2 peak might evidence a permselectivity value of material higher than 1 (Barron et al., 2002, Fishman et al., 1995), and gas composition at the equilibrium can be considered as a good indicator of the level of permselectivity (Barron et al., 2002, Fishman et al., 1995, Varoquaux and Ozdemir, 2005). This is true as long as the respiratory quotient, RQ, is equal to unit and O2 remains the driving force. From model predictions on MAP of red bell pepper, Fishman et al. (1995) demonstrated that lower is the sum of O2 and CO2 partial pressures at the steady state, greater is the permselectivity of the material. For instance, this sum was of 21 kPa and 6.5 kPa for films with a virtual permselectivity equal to unit and 4, respectively. Knowing this trend, and assuming that RQ remains equal to 1, the sum of 15.5 kPa obtained from Fig. 3 indicates a low permselectivity of the WG-paper, which is consistent with the value of 2 obtained from Fig. 1, in same condition of temperature and RH (20 °C and 80% ). The reduction of this partial pressures sum (from the day of packing to the establishment of the steady state) could result in a pressure deficit and / or reduction of the free volume, leading to possible packaging collapse (Al-Ati and Hotchkiss, 2003, Fishman et al., 1995). This was not observed in the present work. Mass of packed parsley was also monitored vs. time of storage (as illustrated for one experiment in Fig. 4). Decrease in weight was almost linear (R^2 > 0.98), suggesting a constant weight loss all along the storage period, that includes (i) water loss due to transpiration and (ii) loss of dry matter due to the consumption of carbon substrates during respiration. It was dramatically high when parsley was stored under uncoated paper (1.49±0.15% day^-1), whereas it reached 0.91±0.20% day^-1 when stored under WG-paper. So, at the end of storage, parsley lost almost 12% of its initial weight when stored under uncoated paper against 7.3% with WG-paper. With a limit of 10% in weight loss before parsley develops visual wilting of leaves, previously established at 5 °C (Alvares et al., 2007), wilting symptoms were expected for parsley stored under uncoated paper. Considering that experimental conditions (temperature and RH, volume, surface area, air movements) were identical in both MAP experiments (uncoated and WG-coated papers), such differences in weight loss were driven mainly by water vapour permeability of the materials tested. Water vapour permeability of uncoated paper and WG-paper was previously determined at 25 °C and a RH gradient of 0-100% : 3.70±0.10 and 1.27±0.06 × 10^-11 mol m^-1 s^-1 Pa^-1, respectively (Guillaume et al., 2010). Consequently water loss was higher in samples stored under uncoated paper than in WG-paper. In a minor extend, gas transfer properties and the consequent inner atmosphere composition could influence respiration and transpiration rate. Both reducing O2 and increasing CO2 contents is known to reduce physiological activity of fresh produce (Kader et al., 1989). Therefore, modified atmosphere reached in WG-paper stored samples could act favourably against both carbon loss (respiration) and dehydration (transpiration) (Kang and Lee, 1998), then reducing weight loss. To better characterised the effect of the headspace atmosphere (and by the way mass transfer properties) onto fresh commodities, change in quality was also assessed during storage of parsley under WG-paper and compared to uncoated paper.

976,Gas transfer properties of wheat gluten coated paper adapted to eMAP of fresh parsley.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'WG paper as MAP for parsley leaves: effect on the overall quality of parsley']"," Overall quality of parsley leaves stored under WG-paper and uncoated paper at 20 °C and 80% RH was assessed through image analysis for colour change, determination of chlorophyll and ascorbic acid contents, and enumeration of total mesophilic micro-organisms, as a function of time of storage. As observed in Fig. 5A, total colour difference ΔE^* increased from day 0 to 8 in a higher extent for samples stored with uncoated paper (to a value of 35) than for the ones stored with WG-paper (to a value of 17). While it followed a quite linear increase in case of WG-paper, ΔE^* evolution exhibited a three slopes profile in case of uncoated paper. This was also observed on the evolution of ΔE^* components: ΔL^* (Fig. 5B) and Δb^* (Fig. 5C), referring to lightening and yellowing of parsley leaves respectively. Δa^* was also considered for ΔE^* calculation but did not change significantly during storage (data not shown). Then, lightening and yellowing of parsley leaves were higher in samples stored under uncoated paper, with a sharp discolouration between day 2 and 4, than in the ones stored under WG-paper, as evidenced on photographs (Fig. 6). As expected, this was well correlated to chlorophyll loss vs. time of storage (Fig. 7A), since yellowing does occur with degradation of this molecule (Sweeney and Martin, 1961). The initial amount of chlorophyll of 210±1 mg 100 g^-1 was in the range of previous results from 182 (Lisiewska and Kmiecik, 1997) to 235 mg 100 g^-1 (Yamauchi and Watada, 1993). After only 2 days, 22% of chlorophyll was lost when parsley was stored under uncoated paper, and 70% at day 4, whereas the amount of chlorophyll slowly falls and loss was only of 28% after 8 days of storage under WG-paper. From experiments conducted on frozen parsley and with trained panellists, mean perception threshold for yellowing of this herb seemed to correspond to a 20% loss in chlorophyll (Philippon et al., 1986). Based on this determination, change in colour might be detected since 2 days of storage with the uncoated paper (chlorophyll loss of 22% ) against 5 days with the WG-paper (chlorophyll loss of 21% ), corresponding to a ΔE^* value higher than 8. Analysis of ascorbic acid content (Fig. 7B) and microflora enumeration (Fig. 8) were also performed. During the 4 first days of storage, evolution in ascorbic acid content was identical whatever the paper used for the storage of parsley leaves: from 231±4 mg 100 g^-1 (quite less than in other work; between 257 and 310 mg 100 g^-1 depending on the variety in Lisiewska and Kmiecik (1997) to almost 160 mg 100 g^-1 at day 4, corresponding to a 24% loss. Then it sharply decreased between day 4 and 6 in case of samples stored under uncoated paper. At the end of storage, parsley leaves lost 68% and 48% of ascorbic acid when stored under uncoated paper and WG-paper respectively. Initial count for total mesophilic microflora was of 3.3 log CFU g^-1. It sharply increased to 5.1 and 6.5 log CFU g^-1 within 2 days of storage in parsley leaves stored under WG-paper and uncoated paper respectively, and then remained constant in each condition. After 8 days of storage at 20 °C and 80% RH and whatever the condition, it did not exceed the maximum limit of 5.10^7 CFU g^-1 or 7.7 log CFU g^-1 specified in French regulation (Francis et al., 1999). Growth rate of mesophilic flora was reduced in samples stored under WG-paper than those stored under uncoated paper. This could be attributed partially to the antimicrobial effect of CO2 (but this might be minimized considering that its diffusivity is low at the temperature of the experiment). Main reason would be the combination of low O2 content affecting the growth of aerobic microorganisms and the antimicrobial effect of some volatile aroma compound released from the parsley. Taking into account the barrier properties of WG coated paper toward hydrophobic volatile at high RH and 25 °C (Chalier et al., 2007), such compounds would accumulate into the headspace. From all these results, it is obvious that the use of WG-paper delayed senescence of parsley leaves when compared to uncoated paper. Wounding fresh herbs (and generally fresh fruits and vegetables) such as cutting is perceived as a stress and induces an increase in metabolic activity (respiration and production of ethylene) leading to a fast senescence. The presence of CO2 in the inner atmosphere of MAP with WG-paper (between 6, after 24 h of packing, and 4.5 kPa, until the end of storage) was assumed to act as an inhibitor of respiration and production / action of ethylene in parsley leaves as previously stated (Lers et al., 1998). Then it might be the cause of senescence-retarding effects, mainly identified as the delay in yellowing and reduction in chlorophyll loss, also observed on other dark green leaves stored upon CO2 content between 5% and 10% (Apeland, 1971, Lers et al., 1998, Loaiza and Cantwell, 1997, Saltveit, 1989, Yamauchi and Watada, 1993). The reduction of water loss in samples stored under WG-paper should also contribute in delaying senescence since the water status of the plant was demonstrated to strongly influence the progress of senescence related events in leafy tissues (Lipton, 1987).

981,Gas transfer properties of wheat gluten coated paper adapted to eMAP of fresh parsley.xml,['Conclusion']," As a porous and consequently highly permeable material, paper cannot lead to the establishment of a modified atmosphere when used as packaging of fresh parsley leaves. Consequently the overall quality of the produce was quickly affected, starting with leaves yellowing since the second day of storage at 20 °C and 80% RH. Using the same paper but coated with WG, so-called WG-paper, in same conditions of storage, modified atmosphere was created and a steady state of 11 kPa O2 and 4.5 kPa CO2 was reached after 45 h. In such conditions, the overall quality of parsley leaves remained acceptable during 8 days, with only 28% loss of chlorophyll. For comparison, parsley leaves (Petroselinum crispum) lost 49% of chlorophyll after 6 days of storage at 20 °C and under 80 kPa N2, 10 kPa O2 and 10 kPa CO2 (Yamauchi and Watada, 1993) and 60% after 8 days of dark storage at 25 °C and 10 kPa CO2 in air (Lers et al., 1998). The establishment of the modified atmosphere was attributed to both the respiratory activity of the fresh produce (not assessed in this work) and gas transfer properties of WG-coated paper at 20 °C and 80% RH. Permeation of O2 and CO2 through WG-coated paper was demonstrated to be RH-dependent and closely related to structural modification in the WG layer. Formation of micro-cracks was evidenced upon drying, but when increasing RH, plasticisation occurs favouring the mobility of protein chains within the coated layer and leading to disappearance of micro-fractures. This reversible phenomenon allowed the WG-layer to recover its integrity when RH is higher than 70% , and the WG character to be expressed in such conditions. "

989,Gas transport behavior of mixed-matrix membranes composed of silica nanoparticles in a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1).xml,['Introduction']," As a means of modifying gas transport properties in glassy polymer membranes, Pinnau and He first reported an unexpected increase of gas permeability in a series of high-free-volume glassy polymers whereby inorganic non-porous nanoparticles, such as fumed silica or carbon black, were incorporated into the polymeric matrix to change the inherent polymer chain packing [1]. Subsequent studies [2], [3], [4] have shown that the gas permeability of non-porous inorganic (e.g., fumed silica, MgO, TiO2)-filled glassy polymeric mixed-matrix membranes do not behave according to the Maxwell [5] and other proposed models [6], [7], which predict lower gas permeabilities than in unfilled polymers. Especially, nanosized non-porous fumed silica particles embedded in glassy polymer matrices have a tendency to form aggregates, which result in disruption of polymer packing and the creation of void spaces. Because of the resulting increase in free volume, the gas permeabilities generally increase with silica content, whereas the selectivities for permanent gases, such as oxygen / nitrogen, are concurrently compromised. This phenomenon has been investigated and confirmed in our previous study [8] through the addition of silica nanoparticles in conventional low-free-volume polysulfone. It has been observed [9], [10] that the relative permeability (i.e., the ratio of permeability of silica-filled polymer to that of unfilled polymer) increased with the penetrants’ molecular size, leading to a considerable decrease in the selectivity of gas pairs such as O2 / N2 and CO2 / CH4. More importantly, the trend of an increase in relative permeability is substantially influenced by the silica nanoparticle loadings that may have arisen from the nonlinearly expanded free volume due to the enhanced aggregates size as silica content increases. The addition of fumed silica to increase the gas permeability of the resulting nanocomposites was initially applied using high-free-volume glassy polymers such as poly(4-methyl-2-pentyne) (PMP), poly(1-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne) (PTMSP), and the perfluoropolymer Teflon AF2400 [11], [12], [13]. In these polymers, the incorporation of nanoparticles led to increases in gas and vapor permeability and, also enhanced reverse selectivity behavior for condensable C3+ hydrocarbons over smaller non-condensable gases, such as hydrogen or methane. Tailoring free-volume cavities by controlling the size and shape of microporous polymers is directly related to the gas permeation properties [14]. In particular, PIM ladder polymers are good potential candidates with the capability to optimize the gas permeability and selectivity by changing the polymer chain packing [15]. Budd et al. and McKeown et al. were the first to report this new class of rigid ladder-type polydioxanes containing highly contorted chains and defined them as polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) [16], [17]. Among these novel materials, PIM-1, containing the contorted spirobisindane unit, has attracted the most attention due to its relative ease of synthesizing high molecular weight polymer and the combination of outstanding permeability with moderate selectivity, especially for O2 / N2 and CO2 / CH4 pairs, which overcome the upper bound trade-off proposed by Robeson [18], [19]. Since the initial reports of Budd et al. and McKeown et al., structurally new PIMs and additional data on PIM-1 have appeared [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. In the present study, fumed silica nanoparticles were incorporated into PIM-1, and the resulting gas permeation properties of the mixed-matrix nanocomposite membranes were investigated. Pure-gas permeability data are reported for He, H2, O2, N2, and CO2 of the PIM-1 nanocomposite membranes and compared with unfilled PIM-1. The effects on the changes in thermal properties as well as the morphology including particle distribution and aggregation by the addition of fumed silica are discussed. In addition, the trend of the resulting permeability-selectivity trade-off relationship of PIM-1 / silica nanocomposites is evaluated. "

998,Gas transport behavior of mixed-matrix membranes composed of silica nanoparticles in a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1).xml,"['Results and discussion', 'DSC and TGA']"," The amorphous PIM-1 and PIM-1 / silica nanocomposites remain in the glassy state until the polymer decomposition point; hence, no thermal transition was observed up to 420 °C by the DSC analysis. Because of the lack of rotational mobility in the backbone of the rigid ladder polymer, it is difficult to observe a glass transition before degradation [20]. Although PIM-1 has been reported as having a Tg, 436 °C [21], we believe this appears to be a probable misinterpretation of the data. Table 1 presents the weight loss of various wt.% of fumed silica mixed-matrix membranes at temperatures up to 1000 °C. During TGA analysis, the initial weight of the samples was affected by buoyancy; that is, the sample and platinum pan appeared to gain weight before significant decomposition occurred due to the differences in thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity for the purging gas and the sample [30]. However, the buoyancy effect was less apparent at higher temperature. Thus, the initial wt.% for all the samples was set at 350 °C. The silica concentration in the polymer (ϕF) is considered as the volume fraction, which appears significantly lower than the weight fraction term because of the high density of fumed silica. PIM-1 and all nanocomposites began weight loss at approximately 492 °C. The weight loss temperature at 1% (T1) and 5% (T5) slightly increased with ϕF, indicating a higher thermal stability by the addition of silica nanoparticles [31]. It is believed that initial decomposition is the result of the loss of trimethylsilyl groups present in the modified fumed silica. "

1001,Gas transport behavior of mixed-matrix membranes composed of silica nanoparticles in a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1).xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Microporous morphology']"," The silica-nanoparticle-filled PIM-1 membranes were observed by SEM. Fig. 1 presents the cross-sectional morphological images of silica embedded PIM-1 mixed-matrix membranes, showing that the non-porous silica nanoparticles are aggregated rather than dispersed individually [32]. Fig. 2 clearly shows that the size (e.g., diameter) of nanoparticle aggregates increases as ϕF increases, whereas the number of aggregate clusters decreases. In principle, the interparticle spacing should decrease with increasing particle loading, if the particle size is constant [33]. However, inter-aggregate spacing is created between nanoparticle aggregates, which become bigger at higher particle concentration. Therefore, additional void volume besides fractional free volume exists in the microporous PIM-1 polymer matrices. Consequently, the size of the aggregates plays a key role in the gas permeation properties due to the formation of void space in the nanocomposites [34]. The aggregates formed within the 24 vol.% of silica-filled membranes are somewhat different from those containing lesser amounts. Moreover, the diameter of aggregates is obviously large, approximately over 200 nm. The aggregate shape is clearly non-uniform compared with the others that appear better dispersed and have a more uniform aggregate size. It is noteworthy that the relative permeability is almost identical for the nanocomposite membranes containing less than 20 vol.% silica, indicating that the local flow pattern around a filler particle is not disturbed by the presence of other particles [6].

1004,Gas transport behavior of mixed-matrix membranes composed of silica nanoparticles in a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1).xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Density and void volume']"," The presence of void volume can be demonstrated by the difference between the theoretical and measured density. In theory, when two different materials are dispersed and blended together, the density of the resulting composite material is ideally calculated by Eq. (2). However, in practice, the density of nanocomposites composed of embedded inorganic non-porous fillers in glassy polymers tends to be lower than the calculated density as shown in Table 2. The density was measured by gravimetric analysis (i.e., samples of known area and thickness were weighed on an analytical balance). This is because significant void space can be created at the interface between polymer and silica aggregates or within nanosized aggregates [9], [35]. Therefore, the packing density of silica-filled PIM-1 membranes is lower than the theoretically expected value. Fig. 3 presents the differences in experimentally measured density (ρexp) and predicted results (ρpred) as a function of ϕF. For the nanocomposite membrane containing the low silica loading ϕF of 7 vol.% , ρexp appears to follow ρpred. On the other hand, ρexp shows a significant drop at high silica loadings and the differences between ρexp and ρpred become significant as ϕF increases. Previously, this phenomenon has been observed for nanocomposites of embedded TiO2 nanoparticles within PTMSP [3]. Fig. 4 presents the relationship of the void volume with added silica amounts as calculated by Eq. (3). The void volume increases linearly with increasing silica content, but above 7 vol.% of silica, a marked nonlinear behavior is observed. This is significant in explaining the changes in gas permeability, which will be discussed later. In polymer / inorganic mixed-matrix membranes, the total volume fraction (ϕT) is the sum of ϕF, ϕP, and ϕV. Considering the occurrence of ϕV, the true silica volume (ϕFT) in nanocomposites can be calculated by Eq. (6):(6)ϕFT=ϕF(1-ϕV)The differences between ϕFT and ϕF increased with silica loading, and became larger due to the presence of high void volume resulting from aggregation at higher ϕF, as presented in Fig. 5. This nonlinear increase in void volume with increasing ϕF is probably related to the formation of larger irregular aggregates in the matrix filled with the maximum concentration of fumed silica. "

Accordingly, the gas transport properties of PIM-1 are considerably influenced by various film formation and treatment protocols including casting solvent type and drying conditions [22]. Table 3 presents the gas permeabilities and selectivities of PIM-1 membranes, which were prepared by various solvents (e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM), and chloroform) and treated by immersion in water or methanol. Treatment of PIM-1 membranes with methanol was used to remove prior membrane formation history. The gas permeability of PIM-1 post-treated with methanol increased approximately 2-fold. The gas permeability of PIM-1 decreases in following order:CO2 ≫ H2 ≫ O2 > He ≫ N2This behavior is similar to that of other high-free-volume glassy polymers, such as substituted polyacetylenes. Compared to low-free-volume polymers, such as polysulfone, PIM-1 and substituted polyacetylenes have a large fraction of interconnected free volume elements, which allow for high diffusion coefficients as well as high gas solubility [37], [38].

Composite membranes having more than 30 vol.% silica nanoparticles were brittle. For this reason, the amount of dispersed silica nanoparticles was limited to a maximum of 24 vol.% , which resulted in flexible nanocomposite membranes as shown in Fig. 6. The gas permeabilities generally increased with ϕF, which is in contrast with the prediction of the Maxwell model. Fig. 7 presents the enhanced relative permeability of each single gas measured at 25 °C and Δp of 50 psig as a function of ϕFT. Matteucci et al. [39], [40] described that the existence of void volume (i.e., macrovoids) at the nanoparticle-polymer interface, between nanoparticle aggregates, or as a result of nanoparticle-induced disruption of polymer chain packing is barely distinguishable. However, it leads to the enhancement of gas permeability. In addition, it is observed that the mode of the enhanced permeability with ϕFT significantly follows the trend of ϕV with increasing ϕF. As discussed above, the ϕV increases nonlinearly with ϕF, and presumably the relative permeability is consistent with ϕV. Fig. 8 presents the increasing relative permeability as a function of ϕV. The permeability enhancement behaves nonlinear with increasing ϕV, which could be attributed to the increase in particle loadings in the membrane. However, the enhancement in permeability tends to stabilize with increased loadings. The trade-off relationship between O2 permeability and O2 / N2 selectivity of several polymers is presented in Fig. 9. It is evident that incorporating silica nanoparticles into glassy polymer matrices leads to increases in gas permeabilities in both low-free-volume polysulfone and high-free-volume PIM-1. However, the selectivity decreases with increased silica nanoparticle loadings and the general trend of the PIM-1 / silica nanocomposites follow approximately the profile of the upper bound limit. "

The specific relationship of void space with silica nanoparticle content was investigated by determining the true silica volume fraction as well as void volume fraction. The incorporation of silica nanoparticles in PIM-1 significantly increased overall gas permeability. This is likely because significant increases in the newly created void cavities upon the addition of impermeable nanoparticles was greater than the permeable space of the unfilled polymer chain packing. In addition, the trend of increased permeability increases nonlinearly with the amount of silica content. The trade-off relationship between O2 permeability and O2 / N2 selectivity followed a similar trend previously observed for polysulfone mixed-matrix membranes with incorporated silica nanoparticles, whereby permeability was gained at the expense of selectivity.

1025,Gas transport properties of polypropylene clay composite membranes.xml,['Introduction']," Isotactic polypropylene (PP) is a versatile thermoplastic material, compatible with many processing techniques and used in many different commercial applications. Among all thermoplastics worldwide, PP has been the fastest growing polymer in the recent decades [1], [2]. The reasons are not only because of its attractive properties for various application segments and a favourable price / performance ratio, but also because of the possibility to modify its properties in a very wide range. The development of composites combining inorganic clays and polymer material characteristics on a very fine structural level is one of the most interesting perspectives for isotactic polypropylene. Typically, inorganic fillers like talc, mica, chalk, smectite and bentonite are used. Due to the difference in polarity between the polypropylene (non-polar) and the filler (polar), different methods can be followed to improve the miscibility between the clay and the polymer, i.e. the fillers can be modified by organic compounds [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] and functional compounds can be used as compatibiliser [3], [8], [9], [10], [11]. The most commonly used clay for the preparation of composites is the smectite group mineral such as montmorillonite [7], [12]. The structure of the montmorillonite consists of two fused silica tetrahedral sheets sandwiching an edge-shared octahedral sheet of aluminium. The silicate layers can be coupled through relatively weak dipolar and van der Waals forces in some cases, or by strong ionic forces, depending on the polarity of the filler. Most of the studies dealt with mechanical and thermal properties of polypropylene-clay composites [5], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. However, studies on gas permeability characteristics of filled polypropylene membranes are scarce. Gorrasi et al. [23] studied the transport properties of n-pentane and dichloromethane in polypropylene-organophilic layered silicates nanocomposites with different clay concentration. It was found that the permeability of both vapours was reduced, mainly due to the decreased diffusion, because the solubility was less affected by the presence of fillers. In this paper, the primary objective is the development of PP-clay composites to improve the gas barrier property that is required for beverage and food packaging among other applications. Natural montmorillonite and organically modified montmorillonite particles were used as filler for preparation of dense membranes. The so prepared membranes were characterized by different physical techniques. Gas permeation measurements were carried out over the temperature range 25-65 °C, in order to determine the permeability, diffusivity and solubility of both the unfilled and filled polypropylene membranes.

The measurement technique adopted in the present work is the time-lag method. The gas permeates through each membrane into a constant sealed volume on the downstream side and is detected by the resulting change in the pressure. Measurements of the rate of increase in the pressure of the gas at the downstream pressure chamber, p1, and the value of the upstream pressure, p0, were carried out by means of pressure transducers with full-scale ranges of 1.33 × 10^3 Pa and 1.33 × 10^5 Pa, respectively, and monitored by a computer. Before carrying out any permeation experiment, a measurement of the pressure increase due to imperfect vacuum isolation of the downstream chamber is recorded. This blank experiment is then subtracted from the permeation experiment performed immediately afterwards in order to calculate the gas transport coefficients from the corrected pressure curves. In this case, the pressure increase is related solely to the gas permeating across the film. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the permeate pressure increase due to leakage was negligible compared to that of gas permeation through the PP membranes. Pressure data are recorded every 10 s. Experiments were conducted at different temperatures by immersion of the permeation apparatus into water contained in a thermostated bath with controlled temperature. Values of the transport coefficients of the pure gases through the membranes were determined in the temperature interval 298-338 K. The area of the membranes, which was assumed to be the same as that of O-ring opening which is in direct contact with the sample, was 5 × 10^-4 m^2. The volume in the downstream reservoir was measured by using the helium expansion technique. The value of this volume was fixed at 9.0 × 10^-6 m^3 by convenience in order to keep the downstream pressure sufficiently low in comparison with the pressure in the upstream side, which was kept constant at a value of 2.40 × 10^4 Pa. The transport of each gas through the membrane is generally expressed in terms of the permeability coefficient P and the diffusion coefficient D. The permeability coefficient, under conditions of steady state permeation, can be evaluated by means of the following expression [26], [27]:(2)P=27376VLATp0dp1(t)dt,where V (cm^3) is the volume of the downstream chamber, A (cm^2) is the effective area of the film, L (cm) is the thickness of the membrane, p0 (cm Hg) is the pressure of the penetrant gas in the upstream chamber, T (K) is the absolute temperature of the measurement and dp1 (t) / dt (cm Hg / s) is the rate of pressure measured by the pressure sensor in the low pressure chamber. Usually, the permeability coefficient is expressed in Barrers (1 Barrer = 10^-10 cm^3 (STP) of gas cm / cm^2 s cm Hg). The diffusion coefficient was obtained from the intercept with the time axis, θ, of the plot p1 against t, as suggested by Barrer [28], [29]:(3)D=L26θ. The reproducibility of the results was evaluated by performing five measurements per sample. It was found that the P and D values were quite reproducible because deviations from the mean were found to be less than 6% and 10% , respectively. Once P and D are calculated, the solubility coefficient S can be evaluated by means of the following expression in convenient units [25]:(4)S=PD. The relative error in the determination of the solubility coefficient by Eq. (4) was estimated as 13% . "

It is observed that the positions of planes (0 0 1) and (0 0 2) were not changed with the montmorillonite modification. In addition, it is clear that the clay C15A showed a new diffraction peak corresponding to a gallery distance of 3.0 nm. This result indicates that the salt molecules were incorporated into the clay structure (C15A). In addition, the two peaks at 2θ = 7.2 ° and 19.8 ° observed also for C15A clay sample indicate the presence of pure montmorillonite in the C15A sample. The PP, PP-C6A and PP-C15A films were also evaluated by XRD as stated earlier. It is known that this technique can show the formation of an intercalated nanocomposite structure by analysing the interlayer spacing (d001) of montmorillonite. When d001 of the clay in the composite is equal or lower than the one for the pure clay alone, an ordinary composite is obtained. On the other hand, when d001 in the composite is higher than in the pure clay, it means that polymer molecules were positioned between clay layers and hence an intercalated nanocomposite is produced. If the peak corresponding to d001 is not observed in the polymer / clay diffractograms, it means that enough polymer chains are inserted into the silicate galleries giving rise to the formation of a nanocomposite with an exfoliated structure in which the polymer is nanoscopically confined [12]. The diffractograms of PP, PP-C6A and PP-C15A membranes are given in Fig. 2. The crystal phase of polypropylene is monoclinic, showing reflections assigned to planes (1 1 0), (0 4 0), (1 3 0) and others [5]. It is found that the unmodified and modified clay affect slightly the crystallographic nature of PP. Another feature that can be observed in Fig. 2 is the relative intensity of PP peaks. The addition of clays reduces the intensity of the peaks, which suggests an increase of disorder in the samples. On the other hand, by comparing the position of (0 0 1) planes in the clays and in the composites it can be deduced the possible formation of a nanocomposite structure. PP-C6A and PP-C15A show that d001 = 1.18 nm (2θ = 7.5 °) and d001 = 1.28 nm (2θ = 6.9 °), which are similar to those observed in the clays. It can be deduced that the incorporation of the unmodified and modified clay gives rise to the formation of conventional composites at a microscopic scale, where the polymer is not intercalated into the silicate galleries. The tensile properties of the composites are reported in Table 3. It is observed the poor reinforcing effect of the unmodified montmorillonite due to the lack of compatibility with the polymer matrix. In contrast, the organophylization reaction favours the dispersion of the silicate into the polymer matrix, giving rise to a sensible increase of both tensile modulus and strength in the PP-C15A composite with respect to pure PP and PP-C6A composite. Similar results are given by other authors [13], [30], [31]. The thermal decomposition expressed in terms of the percent of weight loss as a function of the temperature for the unfilled and the filled PP composites is summarized in Table 3. The decomposition of all materials takes place in only one step with approximately a 90% loss weight. It is worthy to note that the thermal stability improves with the addition of both clays, increasing in more than 20 °C the decomposition temperature of PP. The effect of the filler particles on the crystallization of PP have been analysed in non-isothermal DSC experiments. The average values of apparent melting temperature, Tm and the crystallization peak temperature, Tc, are also reported in Table 3. It can be seen that the addition of the unmodified and the organically modified montmorillonite hardly affects the PP crystallization. The degree of crystallinity estimated for PP, PP-C6A and PP-C15A membranes were 47.8% , 46.9% , and 45.9% , respectively. The addition of the fillers decreases slightly the degree of crystallinity of the PP films. "

1038,Gas transport properties of polypropylene clay composite membranes.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Gas permeation properties of the membranes', 'Unfilled polymer membrane']"," Values of the permeability coefficient of He, O2 and N2 in the PP membrane are plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 3. In all studied temperature range, the permeability coefficients follow the sequence P (He) > P(O2) > P (N2). For example, the He permeability at 298 K is 5.6 Barrers, whereas this value is 2.6 and 1.8 Barrers for O2 and N2, respectively. In addition, the diffusion and solubility coefficients of the gases obtained at different temperatures for the PP film are also plotted in Fig. 3. It was found that the diffusivity of the gases decreases in the following order: D (He) > D (O2) > D (N2); the same order as the gas kinetic diameter (Table 2). Also, it can be observed that the diffusion coefficients for He are an order of magnitude larger than the values for the other two gases. For example, the value of D for He at 298 K is 1.4 × 10^-6 cm^2 / s, whereas this value is 1.2 × 10^-7 cm^2 / s and 7.0 × 10^-8 cm^2 / s for O2 and N2, respectively. In contrast, the solubility coefficients of O2 and N2 were found to be quite similar and both are higher than the solubility of He. Accordingly, the more condensable the gas is, the more soluble in the PP film is. For example, the solubility of He at 298 K is 4.0 × 10^-4 cm^3 (STP) / cm^3 cm Hg, whereas this value is 1.7 × 10^-3 cm^3 (STP) / cm^3 cm Hg and 1.6 × 10^-3 cm^3 (STP) / cm^3 cm Hg for O2 and N2, respectively. It can be stated that both diffusivity and solubility are responsible for the differences observed in the permeability coefficients. On the other hand, the gas transport coefficients obtained for unfilled PP membranes agree with those reported for different polypropylene films in the literature [32]. The transport of gases through the membranes can be described as a thermally activated process that obeys the Arrhenius behaviour. The temperature dependence of P and D can be written as follows:(5)P=P0exp-EPRT,(6)D=D0exp-EDRT,where P0 and D0 are pre-exponential factors, and EP and ED are the activation energies associated with the permeation and diffusive processes, respectively. On the other hand, the temperature dependence of the solubility coefficient is given by(7)S=S0exp-ΔHSRT,where S0 is a pre-exponential factor and ΔHS is the heat of sorption. According to Eq. (4), the heat of sorption is related to the activation energies of permeation and diffusion as follows:(8)ΔHS=EP-ED. It was found that both the permeation and diffusion coefficients obey Arrhenius type of equation as reflected by the reasonably high correlation coefficients (0.95-0.99). The activation energies associated with these processes were determined from semi-logarithmic plots of the permeability and diffusion coefficients against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature. The values of EP and ED as well as ΔHS for each gas in the unfilled membrane are collected in Table 4. It can be observed that the permeation activation energy follows the sequence, EP (He) > EP (O2) > EP (N2), whereas the diffusion activation energy follows the other: ED (He) > ED (N2) > ED (O2). It is observed that the diffusion activation energy is not proportional to square of the kinetic diameter of the gas molecule. It must be pointed out that ΔHS is positive for all gases, indicating that the sorption process in the unfilled PP membrane is endothermic. "

1041,Gas transport properties of polypropylene clay composite membranes.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Gas permeation properties of the membranes', 'Filled polymer membranes']"," The effect of the fillers on the film transport properties was investigated by means of permeation measurements of He, O2 and N2 at different temperatures. Values of the permeability, diffusion and solubility coefficients of gases in the filled PP membranes are plotted in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6. For comparative purposes, the values obtained for the unfilled membrane are also included in the figures. It is observed that the filled membranes exhibit lower gas permeability than the unfilled one, and the gas permeability reduction depends on gas type and temperature. For example, PP-C6A membrane showed a remarkable 77% reduction in oxygen permeability at 25 °C, whereas the decrease is only 27% at 55 °C. In addition, the reduction is more important for nitrogen and oxygen than for helium. The decrease of the permeability coefficient for nitrogen and oxygen can reach 89% and 77% , respectively, whereas the maximum reduction of the helium permeability is 39% . On the other hand, it should be pointed out that there is a slight difference in gas permeability of PP-C6A and PP-C15A membranes indicating that the utilization of the modified clay as filler of PP did not improve its membrane barrier properties. As an example, the reduction of the nitrogen permeability at 25 °C was 89% and 83% for PP-C6A and PP-C15A, respectively. At higher temperature the gas permeability difference between PP-C6A and PP-C15A cases is decreased. This fact, together the XRD results, indicate that both membranes may be considered as conventional composites. It is worth quoting that when using a rubber base polymer, a large difference in barrier performance was reported after modification of the filler [33]. In beverage and food packaging, generally low oxygen permeability is required for oxygen sensitive food product, while for some food products certain amount of oxygen is required (either to preserve food color such as in case of fresh meat packaging in modified atmosphere, or to avoid anaerobic conditions) [34]. Typically, from a practical point of view, a polymer membrane with an oxygen permeability less than 1 Barrer is considered as a moderate barrier, whereas if oxygen permeability is less than 0.1 Barrer, the material is a good barrier [35]. In the present study, as the permeability of oxygen at 298 K is 0.66-0.72 Barrer for the filled PP membranes, these membranes can be considered as moderate barrier materials. In order to understand the effects of the fillers on the membrane gas permeation properties, it is necessary to examine the diffusion and solubility results. An important difference can be observed between the gas diffusion and solubility of the filled and unfilled PP membranes depending on the gas type. The diffusion coefficient of helium experiments a reduction of up to 37% through the filled membranes, whereas the solubility coefficient does not exhibit a definite variation with the addition of the fillers. It is also found that the relative decrease of the permeability is nearly the same as that of the diffusivity. These facts suggest that the diffusivity rather than the solubility is the responsible for the reduction observed in the He permeability coefficients. This reduction may be attributed to the tortuous path towards the diffusing gas molecules and the reduced molecular mobility of polymer chains caused by the filler particles. In contrast, a distinct behaviour is observed for oxygen and nitrogen. As can be seen in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 an appreciable reduction was observed in both the diffusion and the solubility coefficients. For example, compared to the neat PP membrane, the diffusion coefficient can decrease by 49% and the solubility coefficient by 77% , depending on the gas type. In general, the relative reduction is lower at higher temperatures, and it is more important for nitrogen than for oxygen. Therefore, both diffusion and solubility play important roles for the permeability reduction of oxygen and nitrogen through the PP membranes. Beside the reduction of nitrogen and oxygen diffusion coefficients due to the presence of the filler particles, the decrease of the solubility coefficient is also remarkable. This fact indicates that the interactions along the clay-PP matrix interface affect the sorption process of more condensable gases in the polymer membrane, and the presence of fillers could decrease the available free volume in the polymer providing less sorption sites for gas molecules. It is known that the enhancement in barrier properties in composites depends on several factors, such as the relative amount of the filler, the relative orientation and dispersion of the filler particles, and the length and width of the filler particles. Bharadwaj [36] addressed the modelling of gas barrier properties in polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites based on a tortuosity argument. It was considered that the presence of filler introduces a tortuous path for a diffusing penetrant. The reduction of permeability arises from the longer diffusive path that the penetrants must travel in the presence of the layered silicate. Very recently, Lu and Mai [37] developed a simple renormalization group model to asses the influence of geometric factors of layered-silicate fillers on the gas barrier properties of polymer-clay nanocomposites. Both studies showed that the aspect ratio of exfoliated silicate platelets has a critical role in controlling the microstructure of polymer-clay nanocomposites and their gas barrier performances. In the present study, the improvement of the gas barrier properties of the PP film with clays addition is comparable with the data reported using other base polymers [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. In the case of the diffusion dominated case observed when using helium, the reduction of permeability can reach only 39% . In contrast, at low temperatures (i.e. 25-45 °C) the permeability coefficient of oxygen and nitrogen can be decreased in four and ninefold, respectively. Yano et al. [38] in their study on polyimide-layered silicate nanocomposites found that at 2 wt.% clay loading, the permeability coefficient of water vapour was decreased 10-fold with synthetic mica relative to pristine polyimide. Oxygen gas permeability was measured for near to exfoliated polylactide (PLA)-synthetic mica nanocomposites prepared by Ray et al. [39]. They found a fourfold decrease in the permeability of polylactide with respect to the nanocomposite polylactide. Usuki et al. [40] reported a 30% decrease in nitrogen permeability in ethylene propylene diene (EPDM)-clay composite compared with neat EPDM. The oxygen permeability was decreased by ca. 30% in nanocomposites of high density polyethylene (HPDE) and organically modified montmorillonite at 2.8 vol.% of filler [41]. Similarly, the oxygen permeability of polyethylene terephthalate-co-ethylene naphthalene (PETN) decreased by 50% with the addition of 2 wt.% of organoclay [42]. The effect of the filler particles on the permeation properties of the PP membranes was also investigated by studying the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients of the three different gases in the filled films. As occurred for the unfilled PP membrane, it was found that the temperature dependence of the filled PP membranes follows an Arrhenius-type of dependence, indicating that the permeation process through the membranes are thermally activated processes. The values of EP and ED as well as ΔHS for each gas in the filled polymers were obtained and are also summarized in Table 4. ΔHS is positive for all gases indicating that the gas sorption process is endothermic. It can be observed that the addition of natural and organically modified montmorillonite increases the activation energies of permeability coefficient, which can be attributed to the combined effect of both diffusion activation energy and heat of solution. The permselectivity of the membranes was studied in terms of the ideal separation factor, which was calculated as the ratio of the permeability coefficients. The values obtained for oxygen / nitrogen and helium / oxygen are given in Table 5 at several temperatures. The permselectivity values obtained for unfilled PP membranes are slightly lower than those reported in the literature [32], which is probably due to the high degree of crystallinity of the samples used in this study. On the other hand, the inspection of the values reveals that the permselectivity of the films is a rather low for a practical point of view. The addition of the filler enhances significantly the permselectivity of the films towards helium / oxygen mixture, and to a lesser extent for the oxygen / nitrogen mixture. These facts are due to the considerably reduction of the oxygen and nitrogen permeability coefficients compared to that of helium. On the other hand, it is observed that the permselectivity of the unfilled membrane is not very much affected by temperature variation. In contrast, for filled PP membranes, it is found a loss of permselectivity with increasing the temperature. The decrease in permselectivity with the temperature is a consequence of the decrease in diffusivity selectivity as it has been observed by other authors [43]. It must be stated here that functionalised PP with different coupling agents consists one of the objectives of our future work aiming to obtain nanocomposites with exfoliated structure using the same fillers applied in this study. The He, O2 and N2 permeation experiments will also be carried out. "

In addition, results suggest the formation of a conventional composite, where the polymer is not intercalated into the silicate galleries for the PP-C6A and PP-C15A membranes. The thermal stability of the PP membranes improved with the addition of both clays, increasing in approximately 20 °C the decomposition temperature. The presence of fillers hardly affected PP crystallization, with a slight decrease in the degree of crystallinity of the PP membranes. With the addition of both the unmodified and modified fillers, an appreciable reduction in gas permeability compared to the unfilled PP film was achieved. For helium, diffusion rather than solubility was responsible for the reduction in the permeability, in contrast, for nitrogen and oxygen, both diffusivity and solubility were reduced by the presence of fillers. This reduction may be attributed to the tortuous path for diffusing gas molecules and the reduced molecular mobility of polymer chains due to the presence of filler particles. In addition, for more condensable gases, the interactions along the clay-PP matrix interface may affect the gas sorption process in the polymer membrane. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the permeability and diffusion coefficients of gases through the membranes showed that the addition of fillers increased significantly the activation energies of permeability coefficient. This increase can be attributed to the combined effect of both diffusion activation energy and heat of solution. "

1052,High permeability nano-composite membranes based on mesoporous MCM-41 nanoparticles in a polysulfone matrix.xml,['Introduction']," Existing polymeric membrane materials have been known to have a trade-off between permeability and selectivity as shown in upper bound curves developed by Robeson [1]. This limits their use in gas separation applications. Consequently, there is a need for new membrane materials and the development of new membrane structures that exhibit both higher selectivity and intrinsic permeability to specific gases. One potential strategy for fabricating high performance polymeric membranes involves the introduction of inorganic fillers into polymers, forming so called mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. A variety of inorganic materials, such as zeolites [3], [4], carbon molecular sieves [7], silica [5], [6], carbon nanotubes [8], [9], [10], or mesoporous molecular sieves [11], [12], have been explored. The success of the MMMs depends largely on the quality of the interface between the filler and the polymer. For example, in order to enhance interfacial compatibility, zeolites have been modified with coupling agents [13], [14]. Recently, mesoporous molecular sieves have been used in MMMs to enhance permeability or selectivity [11], [12], [15]. Reid et al. reported polysulfone (PSF) MMMs with mesoporous silica MCM-41 for gas separation [11]. Kim et al. enhanced gas permeability of PSF by incorporating mesoporous MCM-48 [12]. They showed that mesoporous materials increased the permeability of the polysulfone MMMs without decreasing selectivity due to good compatibility with the polymer matrix. Shimizu et al. reported that the addition of amine functionalized SBA-15 was effective for enhancing CO2 / CH4 selectivity [15]. However, because the particles were micron sized, the composite membranes were extremely brittle and tended to crack at higher silica loading. Smaller inorganic particles should yield more polymer / particle interfacial area and provide the opportunity to introduce higher percentage loading of the molecular sieves into the polymer matrix. In addition, nanoscale molecular sieves are more suitable for commercialization of MMMs with very thin selective layers than micron-sized zeolites or molecular sieves. Finally, the possibility of additional functionalization can further enhance sorption effects in these particles, raising gas selectivity. The main objective of this study is to develop and characterize organic-inorganic nanocomposite membranes based on nanosized mesoporous silica dispersed inside a polymer matrix. We synthesized a MCM-41 mesoporous silica with ca. 80 nm of particle size and verified its structure and size with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, pore size analysis, and field emission scanning microscopes (FESEM). The structure, absence of defects, and properties of the mixed matrix membranes based on MCM-41 in PSF were characterized by FESEM, sorption studies and gas permeation measurements. "

In this method, an aqueous micellar solution containing 2 g of C16H33(CH3)3NBr (CTAB, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.57 g of NaOH, and 975 g of deionized water was prepared under stirring for 1 h. Then, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, Alfa-Aesar Chemical) was slowly added to the solution at 353 K in an oil bath. The mixture was stirred for 2 h. The MCM-41 silica was filtered, and washed with deionized water. At this stage, the as-synthesized MCM-41 still contained the organic templates. The “unmodified version” of MCM-41 silica was obtained after the “as-synthesized” MCM-41 silica was calcined in air at 873 K for 3 h with 1 K / min of heating rate. This calcined MCM-41 silica was vacuum-dried overnight in order to be used in the fabrication of MMM. The MCM-41 particles were “modified” one of two ways. (1) Silylation with trimethylsilane of MCM-41 prior to CTAB removal was achieved by exposing the silica particles to liquid trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) for 72 h. CTAB was subsequently removed by Soxhlet extraction using 500 ml of methanol and 7 ml of aqueous HCl (37 vol% ). The mixture was refluxed for 1 day and then filtered and washed with ethanol [18]. The modified mesoporous silica samples were filtered and washed in a Soxhlet apparatus with n-hexane, and then dried at 323 K. (2) Amine functionalization was achieved following a previously published procedure.[18] The silylated mesoporous silica powders prepared from method (1) were heated for 4 h at 423 K in dry air to remove all adsorbed moisture. After cooling in dry air, 0.3 g of mesoporous silica powder was treated with 0.3 g of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), dissolved in 100 ml of toluene under reflux for 2 h to form covalent linkages with the mesoporous silica surface as shown in Fig. 1. The excess amines were removed by Soxhlet-extraction with methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) for 8 h and the amine-modified silicas were dried at room temperature under vacuum. "

The membranes were cast onto a glass substrate using a Doctor Blade@ (Paul N. Gardner Company, FL). The glass substrate was covered with a glass cover to slow down the evaporation of the solvent, allowing for the formation of a film with a uniform thickness without curling. The solutions were given 1 day to dry at room temperature. Once dry, the films were placed under vacuum and the temperature of the polymer was raised to its glass transition temperature, 458 K, for 1 h and then cooled down to room temperature. A 6.35 cm diameter circular sample was cut from the film and used for permeation tests. The fabrication procedure for the mixed matrix membranes was identical to the pure polymer membrane preparation with the additional step of incorporating MCM-41 silica. For a 20 wt% of MCM-41 / PSF MMMs, approximately 0.4 g of the pure PSF was dissolved in 3 mL of chloroform and mixed for 24 h. A predetermined mass of MCM-41 (0.1 g) was dissolved in 1 mL of chloroform with small amount of PSF solution (∼5 drops) and sonicated for 30 min to enable the dilute polymer solution to coat the mesoporous silica. This MCM-41 solution was added to the polymer solution and the mixture was allowed to mix for 6 h at room temperature. Following this time period, the mixture was sonicated for 10 min, after which it was allowed to mix for 10 min. This process was repeated several times.

Permeabilities of the polymeric and composite membranes were measured using a constant volume varying pressure apparatus. Permeability was measured directly, and the time-lag method [21] was applied to the recorded data to determine the diffusivity coefficient. The solubility coefficient was taken as the ratio of the permeability to diffusivity coefficient [21]. The gases used for permeation measurements were He, CO2, O2, N2, and CH4 from air products. Each gas possessed a purity of 99.99% and was used as received. The feed pressure and temperature were kept constant at 4 atm and 308 K, respectively, for all experiments.

The TEM images of the calcined MCM-41 particles in Fig. 4 show the existence of highly ordered hexagonal structures with particle size in the range of 80±30 nm. These XRD patterns, pore size analysis, and TEM results are in agreement with previously published results on nano-sized mesoporous silica materials [16], [17]. Poor wetting properties between the polymer and the inorganic material may lead to the formation of nonselective voids or agglomeration of inorganic particles in the polymer, resulting in the loss of selectivity and mechanical properties of the membrane. In order to investigate the dispersion properties of mesoporous silica in a PSF matrix, we carefully inspected FESEM images of MMMs containing unmodified and silylated (modified) mesoporous silica. FESEM cross-sectional images of 20 wt% unmodified and TMCS-modified MCM-41 / PSF MMMs are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) shows that unmodified MCM-41 silica particles agglomerate and form micrometer scale void spaces (indicated by arrows) between the polymer matrix and the silica phase. However, TMCS modified mesoporous silica particles as shown in Fig. 5(b) appear to be well dispersed throughout the PSF matrix. The unmodified nano-sized mesoporous silica has a high surface area covered by hydrophilic silanol groups. Consequently, the silica particles easily adhere to each other via hydrogen bonding and form irregular agglomeration in the polymer matrix [22]. However, after modification of the silica with the trimethylsilyl groups, the external hydrophilic surface is changed into a hydrophobic surface. This treatment can reduce silica-silica interactions and promote silica-polymer interactions, producing a composite with well-dispersed mesoporous silica in the polymer matrix. The FESEM images of 40 wt% of TMCS modified MCM-41 / PSF MMMs are shown in Fig. 6. The FESEM results of 40 wt% TMCS modified MCM-41 are similar to those of MMM with 20 wt% TMCS MCM-41. Even at a loading of 40 wt% , as shown in Fig. 6(a), the nano-sized silica particles are well dispersed throughout the polymer matrix. The resulting composites are free-standing films which hold up to gas permeation measurements. Higher magnification FESEM images of 40 wt% silica in PSF, as shown in Fig. 6(b), indicate that the nano particles have good interaction with the polymer matrix. The few empty cavities remaining represent replicas of MCM-41 silica cleaved away from the liquid nitrogen fractured surface during sample preparation. "

1063,High permeability nano-composite membranes based on mesoporous MCM-41 nanoparticles in a polysulfone matrix.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Permeability of TMCS–MCM41/PSF MMM']"," The permeability results and ideal separation factors for the TMCS modified MCM-41 silica and PSF MMMs are shown in Table 1, Table 2, respectively. Because of different polymer processing and film preparation history, our permeability values for pure PSF membranes are somewhat lower than those previously reported by other research groups [11], [23]. For all tested gases (He, CO2, O2, N2, and CH4), the permeability values increased in proportion to the amount of MCM-41 silica in the PSF matrix. The addition of 10 wt% and 20 wt% MCM-41 to PSF resulted in respective ∼50% and ∼75% increases in the permeability of all gases tested. Consequently, the changes in the selectivities were minimal. At a MCM-41 loading of 40 wt% , the percentage permeability increase scaled inversely with the mass of the gas molecule. Helium was the only exception. The increases in permeability of lighter gases, such as CH4 and N2, were much larger than those of heavier gases, such as CO2 and O2. The gas transport properties through the mesoporous silica membranes typically follow the Knusen diffusion model [24]. According to the Knudsen model, permeance is inversely proportional to the square root of molecular weight of the penetrant. Higher loading of mesoporous silica in the polymer matrix leads to the formation of a connected silica inorganic phase, thus the transport properties of the composite are also dictated by the inorganic phase. In the case of helium, the increase in its permeability is smaller than that of CH4, possibly because the permeability of helium in the polymer matrix is already very high due to its small size. The increases in permeability at 40 wt% of silica loading obviously lead to changes in selectivities. However, the selectivities for the composite systems are still much higher than the ideal selectivities predicted by the Knudsen model, which can still be useful in practical gas separations. The differences in permeabilities of each MMMs can be better understood by analyzing the contributions of diffusivity and solubility coefficients to the overall permeability. In order to evaluate the solubility from permeation data, gravimetric sorption isotherms were measured. As shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), mesoporous MCM-41 silica has a higher adsorption capacity for gases than PSF, because of its porosity and the fact that silanol groups cover the inner surface of the mesoporous silica. For porous filler particles dispersed in a continuous polymer matrix, the solubility of the composite can be modeled by(1)S=ϕMCM41SMCM41+(1-ϕMCM41)SPSFwhere SMCM41 and SPSF are the intrinsic solubilities of MCM-41 and PSF, and φMCM41 is the volume fraction of MCM-41. The calculated values of the solubility coefficients of N2 and CO2 at 308 K as a function of pressure are represented as dotted lines in Fig. 7. The addition of nanosized MCM-41 silica resulted in increases in the solubility of N2 and CO2 in the membrane. However, the measured N2 uptake by 40 wt% of MCM-41 / PSF MMM shows a lower value than the gas sorption values predicted by the additive model. For CO2 adsorption uptake, the measured isotherm is also lower than the model isotherm. In fact the difference between the experimental and the predicted CO2 sorption value is much larger than in the case of N2 adsorption. These differences may be accounted for by polymer blockage of the silica channels. Hydrogen-bonding interactions between the surface silanol groups on the external / internal surfaces of the mesoporous silica and the aryl ether groups of PSF have been reported [11]. Although polymer molecules cannot fully penetrate into the mesoporous silica channels, it is possible that silanol groups near the pore entrance are able to interact with the aryl ether groups of PSF, thus blocking the pore entrance. The addition model uses sorption data from unmodified MCM-41, which is simply exposed to the gas stream, allowing uninhibited sorption and hence, predicts higher sorption for the composite. The solubility coefficients calculated from the time-lag method as well as sorption measurements for CO2, O2, N2, and CH4 are shown in Fig. 8. Although, the absolute values of the solubility coefficients calculated from the time-lag and gravimetric sorption method differ to some extent, the trends in the solubility coefficients with the addition of mesoporous MCM-41 silica are the same. This is consistent with the observed increases in permeability. In addition to steady-state diffusion coefficients calculated using permeability data and time-lag method, kinetic diffusion coefficients were also calculated from sorption data. Fig. 9 presents CO2 kinetic sorption fractional uptake curves in pure PSF and MMMs containing 20 wt% and 40 wt% nano-sized silica. Since the CO2 diffusivity is strongly dependent on concentration, uptake curves were carried out only at very low concentration, 0.1 bar. As shown in these CO2 uptake curves for PSF and composite films, the CO2 sorption equilibrium is attained more rapidly as mesoporous silica loading increases. This implies that addition of mesoporous silica results in faster diffusion in the MCM-41 composite samples. Kinetic diffusion coefficients were calculated from the mass uptake curves (Mt / M∞) by fitting the data with Eq. (2), which represents the sorption of a penetrant in a film as described by Crank:[21](2)MtM∞=1-8π2∑n-0∞1(2n+1)2exp-D(2n+1)2π2tl2Here Mt and M∞ represent the amount of gas absorbed by the membrane film at time t and the equilibrium sorption after infinite time, respectively. D is the kinetic (transport) diffusion coefficient, t is the time required to attain Mt and l is the thickness of the sample. Fig. 10 shows CO2 diffusion coefficients in PSF and MCM41 / PSF composite films determined from the kinetic sorption studies. Also included in this figure are the diffusion coefficients calculated from the time-lag method for comparison. Although the absolute values of the diffusion coefficients obtained by the time-lag and kinetic sorption methods are different [25], qualitatively the changes in the diffusion coefficients are consistent, in that they show increases with the addition of mesoporous silica. Typically, kinetic diffusion coefficients measured by the gravimetric sorption method are lower than those obtained by the time-lag method. This discrepancy occurs because kinetic uptake experiments involve additional diffusion into the dead-end pores, while transport though dead-end pores does not play a role in steady-state permeation (time-lag) experiments [26]. Table 3 demonstrates that the increases in diffusivity occur for O2, N2 and CH4 as well. Overall these results, therefore, suggest that the increases in gas permeabilities in MCM-41 / PSF MMMs can be attributed to increases in diffusivity as well as solubility. While the performance of this particular system did not transcend Robeson’s upper bound, introducing mesoporous silica into polymers with high selectivity, but low permeability could propel their performance above the upper bound. Furthermore, the selectivity can be addressed separately by functionalizing the mesoporous silica with selective functional groups before introducing them into the mixed matrix system. Some preliminary results are discussed below. "

In order to avoid agglomeration of nanosized silica particles at higher loading, the external surface of mesoporous silica was modified with hydrophobic trimethylsilyl groups, which permitted the fabrication of composite membranes containing up to 40 wt% of mesoporous silica. Mixed matrix membranes made with mesoporous MCM-41 materials demonstrated large increases in gas permeability, while maintaining nearly constant ideal gas selectivity, when compared to the pure polysulfone. These dramatic increases in gas permeability resulted from increases in solubility as well as diffusivity. Furthermore, nanocomposite membranes prepared with mesoporous silica whose channels were functionalized with amine groups, demonstrated enhanced permeability as well as selectivity for CO2. "

1081,Improve the gas barrier property of PET film with montmorillonite by in situ interlayer polymerization.xml,['Introduction']," Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was first prepared in 1946 [1] and has become one of the most widely used polymers materials. Because of its low cost and high performance such as high transparency, high stability in dimension and good mechanism property, it can be used in lots of fields including film, bottle and fibre. Bi-axis-oriented PET (BOPET) film is an important product of PET. The throughput of BOPET in China will be 560,000 t / year in 2005 and this number is about five times as in 2002. But BOPET film's deficiency in gas barrier makes it unusable in some package fields that need high barrier property, for example some oxygen-sensitive foods such as beer and tomato-based food. The montmorillonite has a natural nano-scaled layer structure; the gas can hardly permeate through it. Adding it into PET can increase the gas barrier property of the film. Several methods have been used to obtain polymer / organoclay composite materials, for example, solution intercalation, melt intercalation and in situ interlayer intercalation [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Among them, in situ interlayer polymerization relies on swelling of the organoclay by the monomer, followed by in situ polymerization initiated thermally or by the addition of a suitable compound. The chain growth in the clay galleries accelerates clay exfoliation and nanocomposite formation. This technique of in situ interlayer polymerization is also particularly attractive due to its versatility and compatibility with reactive monomers and is beginning to be used for commercial applications [7], [8], [9]. In this paper, the montmorillonite was organically modified and then was added into the PET resin by in situ polymerization. The content of the montmorillonite varied from 1% to 4% . We measured the layer spacing distance of the Na-MMT and OMMT by XRD and observed the morphology of the OMMT in the PET resin by TEM. At last, we measured the gas barrier property of the film. "

1084,Improve the gas barrier property of PET film with montmorillonite by in situ interlayer polymerization.xml,"['Experimental', 'Preparation of PET/OMMT nanocomposite by in situ polymerization']"," In this paper, we used ester interchange of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG) to prepare the PET / OMMT nanocomposite. The synthetic procedures are shown as follows. Twenty-seven grams of OMMT were dispersed in 50 g EG and stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Two kilograms of DMT, 1.4 kg EG (DMT : EG = 1 : 2.2, mole ratio) and 0.8 g zinc acetate (0.04% weight of DMT) were put into the reactor; the mixture was heated up to 140 °C, starting the stirrer at 60 r / min, and the temperature was raised to 180∼220 °C. The ester interchange reaction was stopped when the mass of methanol reach 90% of the theoretical yield (330 g methanol per 1 kg DMT). Then the bis-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) was synthesized. Added into the reactor were 0.6 g triphenyl phosphite (TPP, 0.03% weight of DMT), 0.8 g Sb(EG) (0.04% weight of DMT) and 13.5 g OMMT (dispersed by EG). The mixture was heated up to 250∼280 °C. The vacuum degree of the reaction system was reduced gradually until less than 66.7 Pa. The reaction was stopped when the power of the stirring engine reached the desirable value. The value vary with different reactors, in this paper, the value is 22.5 KW. The PET / OMMT composite (the content of OMMT is 1% ) was pelleted after stopping the reaction. We synthesized a series of PET / OMMT composite. The contents of the OMMT are 1% , 2% , 3% and 4% . The procedure is the same as above. We observed the pattern of the OMMT in the resin by TEM.

1086,Improve the gas barrier property of PET film with montmorillonite by in situ interlayer polymerization.xml,"['Result and discussion', 'Wide angle X-ray diffraction']"," The interlayer distance of the MMT and the OMMT can be measured by XRD. The Bragg formula is as follows:(1)2⁢d⁢sin⁡θ=λ.Here d is the interlayer distance of MMT or OMMT, θ is half of the diffraction angle, and λ is the wavelength of the X-ray. The XRD patterns of MMT and OMMT were shown in Fig. 1. We can calculate the interlayer distance of MMT and OMMT by the Bragg formula. The interlayer distance of MMT is 1.90 nm and the OMMT's is 2.74 nm. The increase in interlayer distance is the evidence that the process agent have inserted into the interlayer of MMT successfully. The increase of the interlayer distance makes it easier for the BHET to insert into the interlayer of MMT. Because there is a carboxyl group (-COOH) in the structure of process agent, the carboxyl group can react with BHET in the condensation polymerization step. The compatibility of MMT and PET can be improved. We also studied the interlayer distance change of OMMT in the PET resin matrix. The patterns are showed in Fig. 2. We can see that there was no diffraction peak when the content of the OMMT was from 1% to 4% . It shows that the montmorillonite has been stripped into a single layer structure. This will be proved in the next TEM research. It is good for increasing the barrier property of the PET / OMMT film that the OMMT is stripped into a single layer because the single layer of the OMMT is easier to orient at the drawing direction of the film.

Potential application, mechanical properties, and barrier properties of soy protein films have been comprehensively reported (Stuchell & Krochta, 1994; Kunte, Gennadios, Cuppett, Hanna, & Weller, 1997; Were, Hettiarachchy, & Coleman, 1999; Rhim, Gennadios, Handa, Weller, & Hanna, 2000). Soy protein isolate (SPI) is a complex mixture of proteins with widely different molecular properties. The major soybean proteins have molecular weights ranging from 200 to 600 kDa. Most soy proteins (∼90% ) are globulins, which can be fractionated into 2S, 7S, 11S and 15S according to their sedimentation coefficients. The 7S and 11S fractions, the main fractions making up about 37% and 31% of the total extractable protein, have the capability of polymerization (Wolf, 1972). The formation of films from soy proteins has been described as a two-step process involving the heat denaturation of the proteins followed by surface dehydration. Upon drying, the unfolded proteins link through intermolecular interactions, such as disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions, leading to the formation of a network (Gennadios & Weller, 1991). In addition, Subirade, Kelly, Gueguen, and Pezolet (1998) reported that intermolecular hydrogen-bonded β-sheet structure is essential for the network formation in soy protein film. The film forming abilities of soy protein fractions (7S and 11S) have been studied. Okamoto (1978) reported that soy protein-lipid film with 11S protein showed a 2-3 times higher TS value than films with 7S protein. The higher tendency of 11S protein to form disulfide bonds is responsible for 11S films being stronger ^(Saio, Kajikawa, & Watanabe, 1971^). A similar result was reported by Kunte et al. (1997) in cast films from 7S and 11S soy protein fractions. Molecular properties of proteins may play an important role in film formations and mechanical and barrier properties of films, as well as film forming conditions and film ingredient. The mechanical and barrier properties of soy protein films have been changed by modifying the functional properties of proteins enzymatically and chemically. The enzymatic and chemical modification treatments of soy protein have included succinylation and acylation (Franzen & Kinsella, 1976), enzymatic cross-linking with horseradish peroxidase (Stuchell & Krochta, 1994), cross-linking with formaldehyde (Ghorpade, Li, Gennadios, & Hanna, 1995), and addition of cysteine (Were et al., 1999). In addition to changes in the functional properties of protein due to modification treatment, the functional properties of soy protein isolates, such as solubility, water and oil absorption, emulsification capacity, and gel forming abilities, tend to be changed during storage due to the aggregation of protein molecules. Hoshi, Yamauchi, and Shibasaki (1982) reported that low molecular weight proteins are aggregated to high molecular weight proteins through hydrogen, hydrophobic, and disulfide bonds. The functional properties of aggregated proteins with high molecular weights differ widely from those of low molecular weight proteins. However, there has been little information available on the relationships between protein molecular weight and film properties. The present research was undertaken to understand the relationships between protein molecular weight and film properties. We fractionated SPI by molecular weight with an ultrafiltration unit, and investigated the effect of the molecular weight of soy protein on mechanical, water barrier, and selected physical properties of soy protein films.

1116,Mechanical properties and water vapor permeability of edible films made from fractionated soy proteins with ultrafiltration.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Molecular weight distribution of fractionated soy protein']"," The SDS-PAGE gels prepared in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The results indicated that the three protein fractions were comprised of similar protein subunits, but their molecular weight distributions were different. Soy protein consists of two major globulin fractions, the 7S (β-conglycinin) and the 11S (glycinin). Protein bands between 43 and 68 kDa indicated β-conglycinin and glycinin, the subunits of 7S and 11S proteins. The protein subunit molecules can form a higher particle size through association-dissociation reactions (Wolf, 1972). For example, the molecular weight of purified 7S and 11S globulins are 193 and 320 kDa, respectively, and they may associate into larger molecules. Because of their subunit structure, the major soybean proteins have a molecular weight ranging from about 200 to 600 kDa or higher (Wolf, 1977). The molecular weight distributions of protein fractions by gel filtration chromatography are presented in Fig. 2. Different molecular weight distributions among the protein fractions were demonstrated by gel filtration chromatogram with the maximum peak of SP-P1 and SP-R3 around 50 and 700 kDa, respectively. This indicated that the SP-P1 fraction is largely composed of relatively low molecular weight protein subunits, and that the SP-R3 fraction is comprised of high molecular weight associated proteins. The molecular weight of subunit and the level of their association appeared to be responsible for the differences in molecular weight distribution in protein fractions. "

1119,Mechanical properties and water vapor permeability of edible films made from fractionated soy proteins with ultrafiltration.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Mechanical and water vapor barrier properties']"," The TS and E values of fractionated soy protein film are presented in Table 1. The molecular weight of protein affected the mechanical properties of soy protein films. Films made from SP-R3, a high molecular weight protein fraction, had significantly (P<0.05) greater TS and E values than did films from SP-P1 and SP-R1P3. The result can be explained by the mechanism of the film formation. The formation of soy protein films has been described as a two-step process involving the heat denaturation of soy protein in alkaline conditions followed by surface dehydration (Wu & Bates, 1972; Gennadios & Weller, 1991). In the alkaline conditions, the disruption of the quaternary structure of protein is accompanied by a partial denaturation (unfolding) of the protein (Peng, Quass, Dayton, & Allen, 1984). Subirade et al. (1998) have shown that a protein regains secondary structure (refolding) by forming an intermolecular hydrogen-bonded β-sheet structure during the cooling phase of the film formation. The aggregated higher molecular weight protein provides more functional groups available for intermolecular interaction since the higher molecular weight proteins are aggregated by a hydrogen bond and a disulfide bond. The TS of SP-R3 is similar to the SPI while the other two fractions have significantly different TS from SPI. This implies that the major fraction contributing TS of SPI film is SP-R3. E of SPI, which showed the largest E value, is significantly different from SP-R3 that is the largest value among the E of other fractions. This may explain the SP-R3 is the mostly contributing fraction to the larger E of SPI. However, there exist interfractional interactions since the E of SP-R3 is significantly smaller than E of SPI. During heat denaturation and film formation process, SP-R3 and other fractions may interact together and increase the E from 73.5% to 110.9% . In contrast to the mechanical properties, water vapor permeabilities of the samples ranged between 0.80 and 0.85 ng m / m^2 s Pa, and were not significantly (P>0.05) affected by the molecular weight distribution of protein in the film samples (Table 2). This suggests that the intermolecular interaction of protein during the film formation did not have an influence on the WVP of the films. This result was consistent with results of Were et al. (1999) and Sabato et al. (2001), which showed that the addition of cysteine and the formation of cross-links did not decrease the WVP values of soy protein films, although they significantly increased the TS values. "

SPI films had higher (P<0.05) PS values (11.9 g / 100 g of dry film) than fractionated soy protein films. The PS values of films made from fractionated soy protein ranged between 3.5 and 4.6 g / 100 g of dry film, and no significant (P>0.05) differences were detected among the PS values of fractionated soy protein films. An increase of protein-protein interactions, such as aggregation of protein molecules by disulfide bonds or a decrease of protein-solvent interactions such as increase of hydrophobicity of film surface, might decrease the protein solubility of the film specimens (Ghorpade et al., 1995; Kunte et al., 1997). Only monomers, small peptides, and nonprotein materials of heat denatured protein film are solubilized in water due to hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds formed during the film formation (Stuchell & Krochta, 1994). Since the fractionated soy protein film networks were formed by hydrogen and disulfide bonding, molecular weight distribution of proteins had little influence on the PS values of fractionated soy protein films.

In addition, the opacity value of SP-P1 film was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that of SPI and SP-R1P3 films.

Although similar protein subunits were found in each soy protein fraction, fractionated soy proteins had subunits with different molecular weight distributions due to association of some protein molecules to form higher molecular weight proteins by hydrogen bondings. When edible films were prepared from fractionated soy protein samples, the different distribution of the molecular weight of soy proteins fractions affected the mechanical properties of films; TS and E values of films increased with an increase of the molecular weight distribution of protein samples. However, the molecular weight of soy protein fractions did not affect water barrier properties of films. "

1135,Morphology and properties of poly(methyl methacrylate) clay nanocomposites by in-situ solution polymerization.xml,['Introduction']," Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a typical transparent amorphous polymer, which is used in various field of our daily life. PMMA has several desirable properties such as good flexibility, hard and stiff, low water absorption, and outstanding outdoor weathering. However, its poor thermal stability has limited its application. To improve the heat resistance, preparation of nanocomposite is an effective way. PMMA / clay nanocomposites offer potentials for enhancing gas barrier, and increasing thermal stability. In recent years, much attention has been paid to polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites, because of its enhanced physical, mechanical, and chemical properties when compared with those of pure polymer [1], [2], [3], [4]. These unique properties of polymer / clay nanocomposites resulted from high degree of dispersion of clay in polymer matrix. There are two distinct nanostructures identified in these nanocomposites, intercalated, and exfoliated [5]. This can be achieved when the nanoscale silicate platelets are well dispersed by delaminating the layered silicate throughout the polymer matrices which results the so called exfoliated morphology. The exfoliated nanocomposite is more desirable than the intercalated one because of the stronger synergistic effects between polymer matrix and silicate layers [6]. However, it is still a challenging work to obtain the complete exfoliation of clay in polymer. Clays are hydrophilic inorganic compound whereas polymer contains hydrophobic group. Therefore, clays have to be modified by organic modifier containing both hydrophilic and long chain hydrophobic group to increase not only the interlayer spacing, but also the compatibility with polymer matrices. Moreover, clay is naturally occurring, environmentally friendly, cheap and readily available in large quantities. It is evident that polymer / clay nanocomposites can increase strength and stiffness [7], [8], thermal stability [9], [10], gas barrier property [11], [12], clarity [11], and decreased flammability [13], [14] with only a small amount of clay. Recently, radical-initiated MMA polymerization has been applied to prepare PMMA / clay nanocomposites because it is insensitive to water, air, and other impurities. The preparation of PMMA / clay nanocomposites through emulsion [15], [16], [17], suspension [17], bulk [18], [19], and solution [20] polymerization has been reported in the preparation of exfoliated polymer nanocomposites. In this paper, we have prepared the PMMA / clay nanocomposites by free-radical polymerization using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as initiator. Being hydrophilic by nature, pristine MMT is not suitable as the starting material for the polymer nanocomposites. Therefore, modified montmorillonite is made by quaternary ammonium salt. After the organic modification by ionic exchanging with amine salts, the organoclay becomes hydrophobic and compatible with methyl methacrylate monomer. We have discussed herein the effect of modifying agent with different structure on the morphology and properties of the PMMA / clay nanocomposites. The morphology of these nanocomposites has been characterized by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thermal and gas barrier properties of these nanocomposites have been studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and gas permeability analyzer (GPA). The optical clarity is measured by UV-vis spectroscopy. "

1159,Oxygen permeability and mechanical properties of banana films.xml,['Introduction']," Food packaging is one of the main factors to prevent quality deterioration and facilitates distribution and marketing. The food industry involves a lot of packaging materials and causes solid waste problem. Therefore, a small reduction in the amount of packaging materials will reduce environmental concerns (Han, 2005). Development of alternative edible and / or biodegradable packaging material to partially or totally replace synthetic polymers may offer opportunities that would benefit both manufacturers and consumers. Various natural biodegradable polymers such as protein-and polysaccharide-based edible films can potentially serve as coating materials for environmental friendly packaging. Edible films or coatings have been proved their functional properties as barrier to solute and gas and prolong food quality and shelf life (Donhowe and Fennema, 1993, Krochta, 1997, Krochta and De Mulder-Johnston, 1997). Even though edible films from polysaccharide, lipid or protein are weaker than synthetic polymer, they provide biodegradation and may be acceptable for human consumption and pharmaceutical application. Fruit and vegetable purees such as peach, strawberry, apple, carrot and broccoli have been used to form edible films and their barrier and mechanical properties have been studied (McHugh et al., 1996, McHugh and Olsen, 2004, McHugh and Senesi, 2000). Those films showed certain moisture, carbon dioxide, oxygen, lipid and flavor barriers, which translated on sufficient strength to protect food and extend shelf life of fresh-cut apples (McHugh et al., 1996, McHugh and Olsen, 2004, McHugh and Senesi, 2000). ‘Kluai Namwa’ banana is one of the most popular varieties in Thailand. Unfortunately, overproduction of this cultivar translates many times in a reduction for producers value. Therefore, searching an alternative to add value to banana is still needed. Since banana mainly consists of starch and pectin (Kotecha & Desai, 1995), these compounds might possibly provide sufficient properties to form renewable, biodegradable and inexpensive films and packages. Recently, starches isolated from banana, okenia and mango were used to form edible films (Romero-Bastida et al., 2005). However, the possibility to form films from whole banana has not been yet explored. Banana flour, obtained from the whole banana, consists mainly of both starch and pectin, which might form films with good oxygen barrier and mechanical properties. These films would reduce the need to isolate the starch, making material preparation easier. Therefore, obtaining films with good oxygen permeability (OP) and desirable film mechanical properties would be an indication of the possible use of banana flour as an alternative secondary packaging. Banana films can be used for dried products and may have a potential to be commercial. Barriers and mechanical properties of edible films and coatings strongly depend on the nature of the materials and final compositions. Generally, starch and pectin films have high elastic modulus; however, films are too brittle for application (Fishman & Coffin, 1995). The usual approach to improve mechanical properties of edible films is to add a plasticizer, which is a low molecular weight nonvolatile substance, into the film to reduce biopolymer chain-to-chain interaction, resulting in the improvement of film flexibility and stretch ability. However, plasticizers also increase the film permeability. Furthermore, pectin is a natural polysaccharide found in most fruits and vegetables. Pectin coating shows its ability to retard moisture loss and lipid migration (Brake & Fennema, 1993). Mixture of pectin and starch can make strong stand-alone films and facilitate film formation (Fishman & Coffin, 1995). Therefore, additional pectin content might modify and provide desirable film properties without changing film permeability. The objective of this study was to form banana film and investigate the effect of banana flour, glycerol and pectin content on film oxygen permeability and tensile properties. In addition, heat sealing was applied to determine thermal property of the films. "

1170,Oxygen permeability and mechanical properties of banana films.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Film oxygen permeability']"," Oxygen is the key factor that might cause oxidation, which initiates several food changes such as odor, color, flavor and nutrients deterioration, so obtaining films with proper oxygen barrier can help improving food quality and extending food shelf life. Fig. 1 shows that increasing banana flour content significantly increased OP (p ⩽ 0.05) of films prepared with 30% glycerol. However, this effect was not observed at 50% glycerol content. Unlike the effect of banana flour content, increasing glycerol and pectin contents did not significantly affect film OP (p > 0.05) at any banana flour content. Generally, hydrophilic biopolymer films have showed good oxygen barrier. An increase in banana flour content should translate in an increase in polysaccharide content (starch and pectin) which should theoretically translate in a reduction in OP. However, banana flour also presents sugars in its composition that might influence the final film performance, since sucrose can also act as plasticizer in the system (Sothornvit & Krochta, 2000b). At higher glycerol content (50% Gly), increasing banana flour content did not further increase OP. Glycerol has been shown as offering much lower oxygen barrier than sucrose in β-lactoglobulin films, which was attributed to its molecular structure (Sothornvit & Krochta, 2000b). Therefore, increasing glycerol content could overwhelm the effect of increasing the banana flour content on OP. In this study, adding glycerol and pectin helped improving the handling and appearance of films without increase film OP. When comparing with other edible films, OP of banana films are in between the OP value of methyl cellulose (MC) films and whey protein isolate (WPI) films and they are excellent oxygen barrier compared with polyethylene films at similar test condition (50% RH and 25±2 °C) (Table 1). Among studied fruit films, banana films incorporated with glycerol still showed lower OP than calcium-crosslinked peach puree films (Table 1). This result indicates the potential of banana films to be used as a natural packaging to protect food from oxidation reactions. For example, appropriate uses of banana films would be for confectionery products, baked foods, nuts and other foods that are susceptible to oxidation (McHugh et al., 1996). In addition, banana films might retard fruit and vegetable respiration rates and extend their shelf life similar to the studies of apple wraps for fresh-cut apples (McHugh & Senesi, 2000), whey protein coated apples (Cisneros-Zevallos & Krochta, 2003) and whey protein coated-and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose coated fresh-cut apples (Perez-Gago & Krochta, 2001).

1173,Oxygen permeability and mechanical properties of banana films.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Film mechanical properties']"," Mechanical properties reflect the ability of films and coatings to maintain a good integrity either as stand-alone films or applied as coatings to a food product. Unlike the effect on OP, banana flour and glycerol contents showed significant effect on film EM,% E and TS; whereas, pectin content showed significant effect on EM and TS (p ⩽ 0.05) as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4. Increasing banana flour helped improve film strength probably due to the higher polysaccharide content, which helped forming the film structure. Similar results were found in gelatin-starch films (Arvanitoyannis, Psomiadou, Nakayama, Aiba, & Yamamoto, 1997). Banana flour also contains certain amount of protein which might enhance the film strength. In addition, adding small amount of pectin enhanced increase in film EM and TS as found in pectin-starch films (Fishman & Coffin, 1995). Pectin is a complex polysaccharide and can form cross-link with protein and improve the strength of films (Thakur, Singh, & Handa, 1997). As expected, TS and EM decreased, but% E increased as glycerol content increased. Since glycerol is a plasticizer, it reduces interactions between polymer chains, thereby reducing film strength and increasing film flexibility (Sothornvit and Krochta, 2000a, Sothornvit and Krochta, 2001). When comparing with other edible films, 8% banana flour-plasticized with 50% glycerol content film presented lower% E and TS (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) than banana and mango starch films (Romero-Bastida et al., 2005) (Table 2). However, EM of banana flour and starch films had similar values. It is implied that extra protein content in banana flour film improved film EM rather than TS property as showed the significant effect in our study. EM of banana flour can also be increased by adding pectin. Banana flour film had higher TS but lower EM and% E than apple and peach puree films (Table 2); however, it had slightly greater stretch ability than carrot and broccoli puree films. McHugh and Olsen (2004) explained the differences in film mechanical properties between fruit and vegetable films due to the difference in the ratio of dietary fiber to total sugars. Banana had a ratio of 0.13 (National Public Health Institute of Finland, 2006), which was in between apple, 0.1 and peach, 0.2 (McHugh & Olsen, 2004). The higher TS of banana flour film can be attributed to the higher fiber content, and the lower% E can be attributed to the lower sugar content of raw banana used compared with lower fiber and higher sugar contents of apple and peach puree films. Moreover, the polysaccharide and protein in banana flour provide additional hydrogen bonding interactions between polymer chains resulting in the film strength (Eskin, 1990, McHugh and Olsen, 2004).

It was found that banana film can form sachets by heat sealing by itself. We filled sugar inside a banana sachet then kept it at ambient condition (28 °C and 55% RH) and determined the moisture content of sugar weekly to determine the time the sugar maintained its initial moisture content. The initial moisture content of the sugar granules was 0.20% . The result indicated that sugar could be kept for 7 weeks without absorbing moisture from the environment (data not shown). When sugar in banana sachet was stored in the polypropylene bag, no moisture gain was observed at ambient condition up to 9 weeks. Therefore, the banana film opens the new application to reduce packaging disposal. "
1179,Oxygen permeability and mechanical properties of banana films.xml,['Conclusion']," Banana flour films can be formed with flexible, transparent and slight yellowish appearances. Banana film strength increased with increasing banana flour and pectin contents, while film flexibility increased with increasing glycerol content. Increasing banana flour content increased film OP. However, it is possible to process desirable mechanical properties without modifying its good oxygen barrier. Moreover, banana film presented sealability, which allows the formation of sachets to pack powder ingredients like sugar, maintaining its original quality.

Therefore, much work has focused on developing polymer / clay nanocomposites using various polymers [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Depending on the clay type and chemical structure of the polymer, several methods have been developed to synthesize polymer / clay composites. The first polymer / clay nanocomposite was successfully synthesized with a polymer containing a polar group because the polar group allowed the clay to disperse readily [13]. Most common olefin polymers without a polar group have received relatively little interest. Recently, three methods have been suggested for olefin polymers: in situ polymerization, the solution method, and melt intercalation. Of these, melt intercalation is the easiest and most cost effective method to synthesize nanocomposites [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Many studies have examined polypropylene (PP) / clay composites prepared using melt intercalation [3], [4], [5], [6], [12], [21]. By contrast, little research has focused on the melt intercalation of PE / clay because of the relative difficulty of preparing nanocomposites using this method. Alternatively, the solution method has been applied to PE / clay nanocomposites. However, the solution method usually needs a large amount of solvent, which causes manufacturing difficulties as well as environmental problems [18], [19], [20]. Wang et al. [19] studied the preparation of polyethylene-clay nanocomposites using melt blending. They used hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide as a reactive compatibilizer in melt blending and obtained improved intercalation. They succeeded in getting intercalated nanocomposites, but not fully exfoliated nanocomposites. Zhang and Wilkie [16] also synthesized a polyethylene / clay nanocomposite by melt intercalation using PE-g-MA as a compatibilizer. Their results indicated that the clay in the composite was barely intercalated [22], [23]. Therefore, there is still a need for research to address the question of how to obtain fully exfoliated nanocomposites [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. This study examines the feasibility of melt intercalation for preparing better exfoliated PE / clay nanocomposites with various compatibilizers and characterizes their resulting physical properties.

[3] to make it organophilic. The MMT (21 g) was dispersed uniformly into hot water (1330 ml / 80 °C) using a mechanical stirrer and a homogeneous suspension was obtained. Octadecylamine (8.3 g) was dissolved in hot water (670 ml) at 80 °C with a small amount of hydrochloric acid for the Na^+ ion exchange reaction and poured into the MMT-water suspension while stirring the solution vigorously. The stirring was continued at a constant temperature (80 °C) for 30 min to yield a white precipitate. The resulting white precipitate was filtered and washed three times with distilled water to remove any remaining acid and octadecylamine. The MMT intercalated with octadecylamine (abbreviated OMMT) was freeze-dried. The freeze-dried OMMT was ground with a mortar and pestle and particles smaller than 160 μm were collected. 
1191,Properties of polyethylene-layered silicate nanocomposites prepared by melt intercalation with a PP-g-MA compatibilizer.xml,"['Experimental', 'Preparation of pre-intercalated compounds']", The OMMT was melt-blended with a compatibilizer at 180 °C for 10 min and at a speed of 50 rpm with a Haake Banbury internal mixer to obtain a pre-intercalated compound (PIC). Two compatibilizers (PP-g-MA and PE-g-MA) were used to investigate the effects of the compatibilizer on PE / clay nanocomposites. The PIC was ground with a mortar and pestle to obtain smaller particles and hence better dispersion in the resin. The ratio of OMMT to compatibilizer was maintained at 1:1.

The amount of compatibilizer (both PP-g-MA and PE-g-MA) in the PECN was kept constant for all the composites by adding the compatibilizer during the melt mixing. The compositions of the PE / clay nanocomposites are summarized in Table 2. "

Dog-bone specimens were prepared using an injection-molding machine. Five tests were performed for each condition. The dynamic mechanical behavior of the PE / clay nanocomposites was measured on a DMA-2980 (TA Instruments). Dynamic temperature spectra of the samples were obtained in shearing mode at a vibration frequency of 1 Hz, at temperatures ranging from 50 to 120 °C at a scan rate of 5 °C / min.

1199,Properties of polyethylene-layered silicate nanocomposites prepared by melt intercalation with a PP-g-MA compatibilizer.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Effects of the compatibilizer']"," X-RD was used to observe the changes in the interlayer distances of various clays. Fig. 1 shows the X-RD patterns of the pristine clay and OMMT. The peak value of 2θ for OMMT was 3.5, which was smaller than that of the pristine clay (6.5). This indicated that treatment with the swelling agent (octadecyl ammonium) changed the interlayer distance from 1.2 to 2.5 nm. Two compatibilizers (PP-g-MA and PE-g-MA) were tested to investigate the effects of the compatibilizers on PE / clay nanocomposites. Generally, a MA group compatibilizer interacts with the swelling agent in OMMT and helps polymer molecules to penetrate the clay interlayer more easily. Fig. 2 shows the X-RD patterns of the pre-intercalated compounds and the final PE / clay nanocomposites. As the figure shows, both compatibilizers increased the interlayer distance of the clays. The X-RD peak around 2.7 (3.3 nm) with PP-g-MA appeared at a smaller 2θ value than that with PE-g-MA which was 3.2 (2.8 nm). This implied that PP-g-MA was better for expanding the clay interlayers. Similar trends were also observed in the final PE / clay nanocomposites. The X-RD patterns of the PE / clay nanocomposites implied that the clays in the nanocomposite synthesized with PP-g-MA were better exfoliated, while there were still stacked clays in the nanocomposite synthesized with PE-g-MA. Although PE-g-MA has the same PE group as the resin, surprisingly, it extracts the organic material from the interlayer, resulting in a slightly smaller interlayer distance of the nanocomposite than that of the OMMT. Based on these results, only the thermal and mechanical properties of the PE / clay nanocomposite synthesized with PP-g-MA were investigated. Fig. 3 shows X-RD patterns of the final PE / clay nanocomposites synthesized with PP-g-MA for various clay contents. In the figure, a small peak appears between 2θ values of 5 and 6 when the clay content was increased above 3 wt% . This implies that the nanocomposites included some stacked clays above this clay content. Since 2θ at the small peak is larger than that of OMMT, some organic material was extracted from the OMMT interlayers during melt mixing with PP-g-MA or the resin. The same phenomenon is clearly seen in Fig. 4, which shows TEM images of 3% and 7% clay content nanocomposites. In 3% clay content material, clays were better exfoliated and dispersed than those in 7% clay content material even though some of intercalated layers are still observed. "

Fig. 5 shows the DSC curves of nanocomposites with various clay contents. The melting temperature of the nanocomposites increased slightly with the clay content. The degree of crystallinity was also decreased with clay loading as previous results [29]. Conversely, introducing nanoclays worsened the thermal stability of polyethylene, as shown in Fig. 6. In contrast to previously reported results [15], the temperature for the onset of thermal decomposition decreased with increasing clay content. Since the nanocomposites contained the same amount of PP-g-MA for various clay contents, the decrease in temperature for the onset of decomposition might have been caused by a difference in the amount of octadecylamine accompanied by an increase in the clay content as reported in previous publications [30], [31]. An interesting phenomenon is seen in Fig. 6. The slope of the weight loss curves of the nanocomposites decrease with increasing clay content, indicating that the decomposition slowed. The thermal properties of the nanocomposites are summarized in Table 3. "

1208,Properties of polyethylene-layered silicate nanocomposites prepared by melt intercalation with a PP-g-MA compatibilizer.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Mechanical properties']"," Tension and DMA tests were performed, respectively, to investigate the physical properties of the nanocomposites. Fig. 7 depicts the average tensile properties of the nanocomposites for various clay contents. The tensile strength and modulus increased significantly with increasing clay content. However, the strain at the break decreased slightly with clay loading. With 7% clay loading, the tensile modulus increased about 49% and the tensile strength increased about 15% as compared with the pure polyethylene. The increase in the tensile properties was higher for the lower clay content region. This suggests that the clay-layers were better exfoliated at a lower clay content and provided a good reinforcing effect, but with further increase of clay content, some of the clay remained partially intercalated and stacked, which weakened the reinforcing effect. The same trends were observed in the DMA results, as shown in Fig. 8. Both the storage modulus and loss modulus of the nanocomposites increased with increasing clay content. The storage modulus of the nanocomposite with 7% clay increased about 45% at room temperature. These results indicate that incorporation of clay in the polyethylene matrix with PP-g-MA enhances stiffness remarkably and has good reinforcing effects. However, tan δ did not change much and one cannot draw any clear conclusions regarding the influence of various clay contents. This implies that the adjustable factors, such as rotor speed, processing temperature, and mixing time did not need to be changed during processing as the clay content increased. This good processability was likely caused by the chemically stable polyethylene, which did not react easily with PP-g-MA or swollen clay. Unlike the vinyl group polypropylene [14], polyethylene lacks reactive chemical groups, allowing good dispersion with physical mixing only. Therefore, the melt intercalation method for synthesizing polyethylene / clay nanocomposites has the advantages of better processability and uniform dispersion with mechanical shearing. "

1220,Soluble soybean polysaccharide A new carbohydrate to make a biodegradable film for sustainable green packaging.xml,['Introduction']," Nowadays, millions of tons of plastics are produced annually all over the world, and their production and consumption continue to increase; this increase has created serious environmental problems due to the materials’ inability to biodegrade (Debeaufort, Quezada-Gallo, & Voilley, 1998). In order to solve the problems generated by plastic waste, much research effort has been done to obtain an environmental friendly material. Most of the research is focused on substitution of petro-based plastics by biodegradable materials with similar properties and low cost. Significant effort to extend the shelf life and enhance food quality while reducing packaging waste has encouraged food and packaging industries to explore for new biobased packaging materials that can reduce waste-disposal problems. Biopolymers derived from natural resources, which have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years, are considered as potential substitutes for traditional nonbiodegradable plastic films owing to their low cost, easy availability from reproducible resources and biodegradability (Janjarasskul & Krochta, 2010). Edible, biodegradable films, by acting as barriers to control the transfer of moisture, oxygen, lipids and flavors, can prevent quality deterioration and increase the shelf life of food products (Gontard, Duchez, Cuq, & Guilbert, 1994). Several studies have reported the use of polysaccharides from different sources to prepare films and coatings with different properties, and have indicated that these carbohydrates are promising materials (Averous and Boquillon, 2004, Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2010, Mali et al., 2005). Polysaccharide-based films are relatively stiff, and have a strong hydrophilic character compared with synthetic packaging films. Therefore, to overcome these films’ brittleness and increase their workability and flexibility, various plasticizers, usually polyols, have been widely used. Glycerol, one of the most studied and popular, is a hydrophilic plasticizer; when added at the correct level with respect to the biopolymer content, it can reduce intermolecular forces and increase the mobility of polymer chains, a process generally used to improve the mechanical properties of edible films (Sobral et al., 2001, Sothornvit and Krochta, 2001). In recent decade, a novel polysaccharide-soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS)-has been extracted from cell-wall material of the cotyledon of soybeans. SSPS has a pectin-like structure composed of a galacturonan backbone of homogalacturonan (α-1,4-galacturonan) and rhamnogalacturonan (repeating units being comprised of α-1,2-rhamunose and α-1,4-galacturonic acid), branched by β-1,4-galactan and α-1,3-or α-1,5-arabinan chains (Maeda, 2000, Nakamura et al., 2002). SSPS has been reported to provide health benefits to humans through lowering blood cholesterol, improving laxation and reducing the risk of diabetes (Shorey et al., 1985, Tsai et al., 1987). Apart from its nutritional value, it has various functions such as dispersion, stabilization, emulsification and adhesion (Asai et al., 1994). Previous study have found that SSPS can be used as a functional ingredient in fortified foods (Furuta & Maeda, 1999). The literature data and preliminary studies in our laboratory have shown that SSPS can produce films with good appearance and satisfactory mechanical properties: it appears to have excellent potential as a film-forming agent. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no specific study on the film characteristics of SSPS. In the recent years, a major emphasis has been placed on the search for new film-forming materials with different compositions and properties. This study aims to develop a novel edible film based on SSPS, with potential applications as an edible film and a biodegradable food-packaging material, and to examine in detail the physical, mechanical, thermal, barrier and microstructural properties of the resulting films as a function of varying concentrations of glycerol as plasticizer.

The sorbitol-plasticized films showed white stains and irregular thickness, and they broke easily during peeling from plates. Thus, we discontinued working with this type of plasticizer. In contrast, the films cast from solutions containing glycerol were found to be flexible and could be easily peeled from the casting plate. Films formulated without plasticizer were brittle, and it was necessary to handle them carefully, and it was not possible to evaluate their mechanical and optical properties. As glycerol concentration increased, films became more flexible and sticky. At macroscopic scale, all films were homogenous and transparent and apparently without pores or cracks, even the ones prepared without plasticizer, as shown in Fig. 1. "

1236,Soluble soybean polysaccharide A new carbohydrate to make a biodegradable film for sustainable green packaging.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Physical properties of films']"," The films’ thicknesses were found to be similar (Table 1). The thicknesses were controlled well because all film-forming solutions were weighed to the same mass prior to casting. Packaging films should maintain moisture levels within the packaged product. Therefore, the films’ moisture content and total soluble matter are the most important parameters in food-packaging applications. Table 1 shows the variations of the moisture content in SSPS films for increasing concentrations of glycerol. Increasing the level of glycerol led to increases in the films’ moisture content. However, the values present a small difference (p < 0.05) between SSPS films with different glycerol concentrations. The presence of water in SSPS films is highly dependent on glycerol concentration. Glycerol, due to its hydrophilic nature, retains water in the film matrix. Higher concentrations of plasticizer favor the adsorption of water molecules, which is mainly attributed to the predisposition of plasticizers to form hydrogen bonds (OH). The water solubility of SSPS films is shown in Table 1. Results demonstrated that increasing glycerol from 20% to 40% increased film solubility; however, the differences observed were not significant (P > 0.05). The results obtained are directly attributable to the hydrophilic behavior of glycerol in SSPS films. Generally, high solubility would indicate lower water resistance; however, for some applications, such as packaging wrap, high solubility is an indicator of biodegradability, which could be an advantage (Stuchell & Krochta, 1994). This is the case when the film or coating will be consumed simultaneously with the food. Similar results were also observed by Ghasemlou, Khodaiyan, Oromiehie, and Yarmand (2011) and Ahmadi, Kalbasi-Ashtari, Oromiehie, Yarmand, and Jahandideh (2012), who suggested that increasing the glycerol content in films increased the water-soluble dry content. The addition of glycerol also had a strong influence over the water uptake. The unplasticized films had lower moisture absorption than the glycerol-plasticized films. However, water uptake increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increased glycerol concentration (Table 1). These results were in accordance with those of Ghanbarzadeh and Almasi (2011), who reported that higher concentrations of glycerol in the carboxymethyl cellulose-based films gave a higher hydrophilicity, leading to the films’ increased water uptake.

1238,Soluble soybean polysaccharide A new carbohydrate to make a biodegradable film for sustainable green packaging.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Water vapor permeability (WVP)']"," Since a main function of a food packaging is often to avoid, or at least to decrease, moisture transfer between the food and the surrounding atmosphere, WVP should be as low as possible (Hosseini, Rezaei, Zandi, & Ghavi, 2013). The WVP of SSPS films containing various concentrations of glycerol as plasticizer are shown in Table 1. There was a significant difference between the WVP values of films made with different glycerol concentrations (p < 0.05). The increase in WVP with increasing hygroscopic plasticizer concentration is common in edible films (Cuq et al., 1997, Sobral et al., 2001). The same behavior was shown in the study of Cuq et al. (1997), who suggested that the increased WVP in films as a consequence of adding plasticizer was due to the reorganization of the polymeric network, thereby making the structure less dense and increasing free volume. Consequently, there is greater space for water and other molecules to migrate through the film structure. As a result, it promotes the sorption of water to relative humidities above 80% . Under these conditions, the plasticizing effect of water is additional to that of glycerol, thus explaining the films’ higher WVP (Gontard et al., 1994). Cuq et al. (1997) also mentioned that WVP and water content in films tended to increase with increasing glycerol concentration due to higher numbers of polar groups present in the films (hydrophilic plasticizer being compatible with hydrophilic film-forming materials like SSPS, thereby enhancing sorption of polar molecules like water). Consequently, this would again increase water diffusion within the polymer matrix of the film. The WVP value of SSPS films was in the range of 0.93 × 10^-10 g m / m^2 s Pa-3.28 × 10^-10 g m / m^2 s Pa, and was less permeable to water vapor than the films from psyllium-seed gum examined by Ahmadi et al. (2012), who found WVPs in the range of 1.16 and 1.88 × 10^-10 g m^-1 s^-1 Pa. Additionally, the moisture-barrier properties of the SSPS films were slightly higher than those of cellophane (0.84 × 10^-10 g m^-1 s^-1 Pa) (Shellhammer & Krochta, 1997), suggesting their application in some food products.

1239,Soluble soybean polysaccharide A new carbohydrate to make a biodegradable film for sustainable green packaging.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Optical properties']"," Color parameters of studied SSPS films are presented in Table 2. Our results showed that all of the color parameters of SSPS films, with the exception of the a value, were significantly (p < 0.05) changed when glycerol concentration increased. Incorporation of glycerol increased film lightness, as evidenced by higher (P < 0.05) L values. Conversely, yellowness (b values) decreased with incorporation of glycerol (Table 2). The SSPS films with 40% glycerol had the highest L, and were lighter than the 20% -glycerol films. The overall color of the films was lightened with incorporation of glycerol. Therefore, addition of plasticizer to SSPS films can improve their optical properties. Color functions such as ΔE, which indicates the degree of total color difference from the standard color plate, YI, which indicates degree of yellowness, and WI, which indicates degree of whiteness can be described as a result of increasing glycerol concentration in SSPS films. While WI increased significantly (p < 0.05) as a result of increase in glycerol concentration, YI decreased considerably. ΔE showed the same pattern as YI, indicating that the color difference of glycerol-incorporated SSPS film was mainly due to changes in yellowness. These results agreed with visual observations. Similar effects on color parameters from adding glycerol to the film matrix have been previously observed by Ghasemlou et al. (2011) and Ahmadi et al. (2012). The films obtained in this work have the advantage of providing light-barrier properties, which can be desirable depending on the film's application in food products. "

The effect of plasticizer concentration on the mechanical properties of SSPS-based films is presented in Fig. 2. The TS of plasticized SSPS films decreased (P < 0.05) when glycerol content increased from 20% (18.58 MPa) to 30% (11.27 MPa). For the same amount of added glycerol, the EB values of the films improved (P < 0.05) when the quantities of plasticizer were increased. Furthermore, when glycerol concentration increased from 30% to 40% , this behavior was more evident, with a decrease of TS value of approximately 62% and an increase of EB value of 48% . Based on these results, it can be concluded that increasing the glycerol concentration in SSPS films improved film extensibility and reduced its resistance. The typical effects on mechanical properties of adding plasticizers, such as increases in elongation and decreases in tensile strength, have been broadly discussed in the literature (Abdorreza et al., 2011, Lourdin et al., 1997). Plasticizers interfere with polymer chains: they decrease intermolecular forces, soften the rigidity of the film's structure and facilitate the sliding of chains, and thus help to improve the overall flexibility of the films. A comparison of the tensile test results obtained in this study to those reported for synthetic polymers shows comparable TS values between SPSS films and both low-and high-density polyethylene, reported between 9-17 MPa and 16-41 MPa, respectively (Smith, 1986). EB values for the SPSS films tested in this study were better than those for cellophane and polystyrene, which have been reported between 15-25% and 1-10% , respectively (Gennadios et al., 1993). "

Unplasticized SSPS films had a Tg of 30.82 °C, which was higher than those of glycerol-plasticized films. A comparison of the results of different plasticized films showed that increasing the glycerol concentration decreased the Tg of the films from 24.67 °C (20% (w / w) glycerol) to 21.92 (30% (w / w) glycerol) and 19.73 °C (40% (w / w) glycerol) (Table 3). Similar results were obtained by Arvanitoyannis, Psomiadou, Nakayama, Aiba, and Yamamoto (1997) with films of gelatin / starch blends plasticized with glycerol or sorbitol, and by Carvalho and Grosso (2004) with films based on gelatin plasticized with glycerol. Glycerol, due to its plasticizing effect, decreases glass-transition temperatures of polysaccharide films, which is in agreement with the free-volume theory of plasticization. Table 3 also shows the changes in ΔHm and Tm of SSPS films with increases in glycerol concentration. Increases in glycerol concentration lead to an increase in ΔHm, and to a decrease in Tm values. As a result, the observed single glass transition for all glycerol-plasticized films was attributed to the whole polymer matrix. They remained homogeneous throughout the heating cycle, as no phase separation was observed (data not shown). If blends of polymer and plasticizers are immiscible, the mixture will exhibit two Tg and Tm corresponding to the two pure phases (Ghasemlou, Khodaiyan, & Oromiehie, 2011a). "

However, plasticized SSPS films showed remarkable differences in terms of surface microstructure compared to the control film, probably due to the hydrophilicity of glycerol, which may absorb higher water content. As the concentration of glycerol increased from 20 to 40% , the film surface appeared to be much rougher. The voids on the surface of the films could be the site for water binding during moisture absorption, which may explain the slightly higher WVP of the films. Cross-section images revealed that control films had a rough and uneven structure, while glycerol-plasticized films showed a smooth and uniform internal-structure morphology.

SSPS films with a glycerol concentration of 20% generally possessed the lowest WVP values, and may have some commercial potential for food-packaging applications.

1250,Structure–property relationships in cross-linked polyester–clay nanocomposites.xml,['abstract']," Crosslinked polyester-clay nanocomposites were prepared by dispersing organically modified montmorillonite in prepromoted polyester resin and subsequently crosslinked using methyl ethyl ketone peroxide catalyst at several different clay concentrations (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 wt% ). X-ray diffraction studies revealed the formation of a nanocomposite in all cases with the disappearance of the peak corresponding to the basal spacing of the pure clay. Transmission electron microscopy was used to study the morphology at different length scales and showed the nanocomposite to be comprised of a random dispersion of intercalated / exfoliated aggregates throughout the matrix. Thermal degradation of the nanocomposites was found to be slightly but progressively hastened compared to the pure crosslinked polymer, loss and storage modulus were monotonically shifted toward higher frequency values, and the tensile modulus was found to decrease with increasing clay content. These unexpected results were rationalized based on the decrease in the degree of crosslinking of the polyester resin in the nanocomposite, in the presence of clay. In particular, the nanocomposite containing 2.5 wt% clay consistently demonstrated a drop in properties far greater than that observed at other clay concentrations, and was attributed to the greater degree of exfoliation seen in this case which presumably leads to a greater decrease in the degree of crosslinking. Oxygen permeability rates in the polyester nanocomposites decreased with increasing clay content, as expected, and was satisfactorily reproduced using a tortuosity based model. "

1254,Structure–property relationships in cross-linked polyester–clay nanocomposites.xml,['Introduction']," There is now a considerable body of literature since the seminal work by the Toyota research group [1], [2], [3] demonstrating that nanoscopic dispersion of platelet-like structures such as clays (aluminosilicates) in a polymeric matrix results in remarkable property enhancements. For example, dramatic improvements in the stiffness and strength [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], increased dimensional stability [7], [8], improved flame retardancy [9], [10], improved solvent and UV resistance [11], [12], and reduction in permeability to gases [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] have been reported in a wide range of polymers. Most notably, the property improvements resulting from the formation of a nanocomposite occur at extremely low concentrations of the aluminosilicate (1-5 vol% ) compared to conventional phase-separated composites of a filler material in a polymer (20-30 vol% ). The extremely large surface area available for interactions with a polymeric matrix coupled with high aspect ratio (between 30 and 2000) are largely responsible for the observed enhancements. Clays or layered aluminosilicates are crystalline materials consisting of 1 nm thick layers (or sheets) which are made up of an octahedral sheet of alumina fused to two tetrahedral sheets of silica. These layers are essentially polygonal two-dimensional sheets, possessing a thickness of ∼1 nm and ranging between 30 and 2000 nm in diameter. Frequently, isomorphic substitutions in these sheets lead to a net negative charge necessitating the presence of cationic counter-ions in the inter-sheet region or gallery spacing. The counter-ions are frequently exchanged with organic alkyl ammonium modifiers that lead to more favorable interactions with a polymer. Morphological descriptors such as intercalation and exfoliation are commonly used to describe the state of aggregation of the individual sheets of clay in the polymer. The former refers to the state where the gallery regions between the aluminosilicate sheets are swollen by polymer chains while retaining the regular stacking arrangement. The latter generally represents the situation where the sheets are completely delaminated and dispersed in the matrix. It is important to note that a distinct morphological hierarchy is extant in polymer-clay nanocomposites that is difficult to capture with the aid of just two morphological descriptors. Three routes, in situ polymerization [2], [11], [18], solvent casting [19], [20] and melt compounding [6], [21] techniques may be used to prepare polymer nanocomposites. All the three methods involve the precise matching of interactions between the polymer / monomer and the aluminosilicate, which generally represents the limiting step in nanocomposite formation. Kornmann et al. [22] reported dispersions of montmorillonite clay in unsaturated polyester resin that lead to cured composites that displayed partial delamination of the aluminosilicate. They found that the fracture toughness doubled by dispersing merely 1.5 vol% of aluminosilicate with concomitant increases in other mechanical properties. Suh et al. [23] demonstrated that the resulting properties of polyester-clay nanocomposites were greatly dependent on the preparation procedure with regard to the order of mixing of the clay, polyester resin and promoter (styrene monomer), as well as, the curing conditions. In this work, we report the preparation and characterization of polyester-clay nanocomposites crosslinked at room temperature with an aim to establish the structure-property relationships extant in these systems. In particular, establishing the morphological hierarchy extant at different length scales (several microns versus several hundred nanometers), and its connection to the macroscopically observed properties form the theme of this work.

Cloisite^® 30B, a natural montmorillonite modified with methyl tallow bis-2-hydroxyethyl quaternary ammonium chloride was mixed with the low viscosity polyester resin to prepare the nanocomposites was obtained from Southern Clay Products. This particular organically modified clay was chosen due to the presence of the polar hydroxyl group that presumably provides a good wetting surface for the unsaturated polyester. Several different clay concentrations in the crosslinked polyester resin were investigated (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 wt% ). These wt% concentrations correspond to 0.5, 1.4, 2.8 and 5.8 vol% , converted using a density of 1.10 g cm^-3 for the cured polyester resin and 1.98 g cm^-3 for the Cloisite^® 30B nanoclay. We note that the concentrations reported are total concentrations, which include the contribution from the organic modifier. An appropriate amount of the organically modified clay was added to the resin and mechanically stirred followed by sonication for 1 h, which resulted in well-dispersed, stable suspensions of the clay in the polyester resin. Crosslinking was initiated by adding ∼1.5 vol% of MEKP catalyst to the resin-clay mixture at room temperature as recommended by the manufacturer. The crosslinking reaction was noticeably slower at the higher clay concentrations (>2.5 wt% ). Samples were allowed to cure for at least 24 h at room temperature before initiating analysis.

1257,Structure–property relationships in cross-linked polyester–clay nanocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Structure and morphology']"," It is useful to start by establishing the morphological state of the crosslinked polyester-clay nanocomposites. This has been accomplished by using X-ray diffraction and TEM. The X-ray scattering intensities for the organically modified clay, Cloisite^® 30B, and the polyester-clay nanocomposites containing different concentrations of clay are shown in Fig. 1. In the scattering curve for the pure clay, a prominent peak corresponding to the basal spacing of Cloisite^® 30B organically modified montmorillonite occurs at a d-spacing of 17.8 Å. This reflection is absent in the scattering curves for all the polyester-clay nanocomposites, irrespective of clay concentration, confirming the formation of a nanocomposite. The presence of order at higher d-spacing (>26 Å or 3.5 ° 2θ) could not be confirmed from the data. TEM allows the morphological state of the nanocomposite to be delineated more completely. It is instructive to consider the structural hierarchy of clay particles as a prelude to understanding the morphology of the polymer nanocomposite evidenced in the micrographs. Montmorillonite clay consists of a hierarchy of structures, of which the individual aluminosilicate sheets (∼1 nm thick) may be considered the basic structural unit. Several sheets stacked face to face with an interlayer charge balancing cation lead to a stack and an agglomeration of these stacks leads to the macroscopically observable micron-sized particles. Therefore, each macroscopic particle of clay is actually comprised of many individual aluminosilicate sheets. Consequently, the formation of a nanocomposite involves the break-up and dispersion of the agglomerated stacks of sheets followed by the swelling of the gallery spacing between the sheets by the polymer / monomer. The TEM micrographs shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3attempt to demonstrate this hierarchy and its preservation in the final nanocomposite by using different magnifications in the imaging. Low magnification micrographs, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, show the dispersion of micron-sized aggregates of sheets in the matrix. Fewer aggregates are observed in Fig. 2(a) since the concentration of clay is accordingly lower (2.5 wt% ) in this case. Increasing the magnification in an area occupied by an aggregate reveals the individual sheets of clay clearly separated by a layer of polymer as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. It is evident that the morphology may be considered a mix of intercalated and exfoliated sheets. That is, there are regions where the regular stacking arrangement is maintained with a layer of polymer between the sheets, and also regions where completely delaminated sheets are dispersed individually. In the case of the 2.5 wt% clay containing nanocomposite, regions such as those shown in Fig. 2(c) were detected showing individual dispersion of completely delaminated sheets in the matrix. There appears to be some evidence supporting the formation of an exfoliated morphology at a more global scale in the 2.5 wt% polyester-clay nanocomposite. It is also noted that a high degree of orientational order of the aluminosilicate sheets is present within the stacks of the intercalated and exfoliated aggregates. The evidence shown here in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 clearly demonstrates the need for the microstructure to be investigated at different magnifications to establish the hierarchy. In the interest of clarity, the morphology extant in the nanocomposites delineating this structural hierarchy has been shown in Fig. 4. This essentially conveys a three-dimensional perspective of the morphology at different length scales. Establishing local versus global morphology and orientational order of the sheets is central to efficient characterization of nanocomposite structures. For example, a situation may be envisaged where the clay sheets are completely delaminated and homogeneously dispersed throughout the matrix, or there may be localized regions of exfoliated sheets dispersed throughout the matrix. These two situations presumably result in nanocomposites that are completely different in terms of properties and determining this difference may hold the key to understanding the macroscopic behavior. This argument points to the clear need for the development of more robust morphology descriptors in nanocomposites that takes into account both the short and long-range order and dispersion of the aluminosilicate sheets. Notwithstanding the issues discussed earlier, it can be concluded that the morphology of the crosslinked polyester-clay nanocomposites can be described as a dispersion of intercalated and exfoliated aggregates in the matrix.

One of the most important property enhancements expected upon formation of a polymer nanocomposite is in the retardation of the thermal degradation [20], [24]. TGA of the crosslinked polyester nanocomposites displays the exact opposite behavior. The onset of degradation is slightly but progressively hastened upon addition of clay to the nanocomposites as compared to the pure polymer seen in Fig. 5. The pure polymer is completely decomposed at 400 °C. The nanocomposites degrade at a faster rate in the temperature range 25-400 °C compared to the pure polymer and thereafter the situation reverses. It is not surprising that the nanocomposites show slower degradation above 400 °C since there is only inorganic aluminosilicate left in the system at that stage. The monotonic increase in the rate of degradation in the nanocomposites may be due to the presence of increasing amount of hydroxyl groups in the organic modifier that provides a supply of oxygen. "

The behavior manifested in the G' and G″ is remarkable in many respects. First, the G' and G″ values decrease monotonically with increasing clay concentration whereas, the exact opposite is expected for a nanoscopically reinforced polymer [26]. Second, the G' and G″ curves follow from left to right in Fig. 6 in the order 0.0, 1.0, 5.0, 2.5 and 10.0 wt% . That is, G' and G″ values are lower for 2.5 wt% case compared to the 5.0 wt% case. The dependence of the tensile modulus on the clay concentration shown in Fig. 7, bears out the earlier observations. First, the tensile modulus is seen to decrease with increasing clay content, and second, the drop in the value for the 2.5 wt% nanocomposite is greater than expected. A combination of the morphology and the extent of crosslinking in the polyester-clay nanocomposites can be used to understand this phenomenon. It is proposed that the intercalation and exfoliation of the clay in the polyester resin serves to effectively decrease the number of crosslinks from a topological perspective. The overall decrease in the G', G″, and tensile modulus of the polymer nanocomposites with increasing clay content lend credence to the hypothesis that the degree of crosslinking is indeed reduced. The origin of the greater drop in properties of the 2.5 wt% nanocomposite may be traced to the morphology shown in Fig. 2(c), where it was observed that the sample showed exfoliation on a more global scale compared to the 10 wt% sample. In terms of the explanation put forth, the crosslink density is inversely proportional to the degree of exfoliation and macroscopic dispersion. Permeability studies discussed in Section 3.4 also bear out these observations, as well as, lending further support to the explanation put forth. "

1267,Structure–property relationships in cross-linked polyester–clay nanocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'O2 permeability']"," The gas barrier properties have been shown to improve dramatically upon exfoliation of clay platelets in a number of polymeric matrices [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The mechanism for the improvement is attributed to the increase in the tortuosity of the diffusive path for a penetrant molecule. Indeed, a simple tortuosity based model [27], [28] has been found to reproduce experimental trends satisfactorily [13], [14], [15], [16]. This observation is surprising, essentially implying that the nanoscale interactions between the polymeric matrix and the clay sheets do not change the thermodynamic solubility of the penetrant significantly. The permeability of the nanocomposite (Ps) is related to the permeability of the pure polymer (Pp) and the volume fraction (φs) and length (L) and width (W) of the sheets as [27]PsPp=1-φs1+L2WφsThe above expression assumes that the sheets are placed such that the sheet plane is perpendicular to the diffusive pathway. Recently, extensions to the tortuosity-based model to include both orientational order and state of dispersion of the sheets in addition to the concentration and sheet dimension variables were proposed [29]. There it was shown that the nanocomposites could adopt variable widths or lengths depending on the state of dispersion. The width of the basic structural unit of montmorillonite (a single aluminosilicate sheet) is well defined at W∼1 nm, however, the length displays a rather large distribution ranging between 100 nm and several microns. For the remainder of the discussion we shall implicitly assume a uniform platelet size distribution. Furthermore, the effective length and width of the nanocomposite can change rapidly through aggregation as shown in the schematic in Fig. 8. This raises the issue of whether diffusion within the aggregates itself is a possibility, but for the purposes here we shall assume that the aggregates of silicate sheets are essentially impermeable. We also ignore the possibility of trapping of the penetrant within these dense aggregates. The permeability of O2 in the crosslinked polyester films is shown in Fig. 8 as a function of the volume fraction of clay. As expected, the permeability of O2 through the crosslinked polyester nanocomposite films decreases relative to the pure crosslinked polyester film. Therefore, in terms of barrier properties, the behavior manifested is in keeping with the expectation. More importantly, we note that the decrease in O2 permeability at 2.5 wt% clay content is greater than at other concentrations. This is in agreement with the behavior observed in the G', G″ and tensile modulus data. We note that this effect appears to be real, in that, fresh batches of resin-clay mixtures were used for each of the characterization experiments discounting the possibility of error in the preparation stage. The two curves shown in Fig. 8 represent two different values of L / 2W used in the above expression. The thick and thin lines represent the decrease in permeability predicted by the above expression for two effective aspect ratios, L / 2W=100 and 28, respectively, representing different degrees of aggregation. The 2.5 wt% data point corresponds closely to the effective L / 2W value of 100 indicative of greater dispersion of the silicate sheets. At higher clay concentrations, the decrease in permeability follows a different curve best fit by an L / 2W value of 28 implying a higher degree of aggregation. This implies that the degree of aggregation increases with the clay concentration, supported by the TEM micrographs shown in Fig. 3. At 2.5 wt% it was found that limited exfoliation on more global scale also occurred in addition to the intercalated / exfoliated aggregates. Accordingly, the decrease in permeability is also far greater. The improvement in permeability for the nanocomposite containing 2.5 wt% clay over the pure crosslinked polymer is approximately a factor of 2.7. The barrier property of nanocomposites is profoundly impacted by the morphology of polymer nanocomposites and here again the importance of delineating the morphology at different scales becomes important.

1269,Structure–property relationships in cross-linked polyester–clay nanocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Optical properties']"," One of the attractive prospects of nanoscale dispersion of ∼300 nm silicate platelets in a polymer matrix is the formation of nanocomposites that are optically clear [25]. The crosslinked polyester-clay nanocomposites prepared were optically clear even at 10 wt% clay content. Dependence of the thickness normalized% transmittance on clay concentration in the nanocomposites is shown in Fig. 9. The drop in transmittance ranges from being negligible at 1 wt% to 10% at 2.5 wt% , and 20% at 5 wt% clay. At 10 wt% clay concentration, there is ∼30% loss in transmittance due to scattering and / or absorption. Here again, the state of dispersion and orientation of the platelets governs the optical clarity of the nanocomposite films. If complete delamination and homogeneous dispersion of the aluminosilicate sheets were achieved, it is possible that fairly high concentrations of clay may be incorporated with lower losses in the optical clarity.

1271,Structure–property relationships in cross-linked polyester–clay nanocomposites.xml,['Conclusions']," Polyester-clay nanocomposites were prepared by dispersing methyl tallow bis-2-hydroxyethyl quaternary ammonium chloride modified montmorillonite in prepromoted polyester resin and subsequently crosslinked at room temperature. The formation of a nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and TEM. The morphology has been studied at different length scales and is best described as a dispersion of intercalated / exfoliated aggregates of clay sheets in the matrix. Thermal, rheological, mechanical, gas transport and optical transmission properties of the crosslinked polyester-clay nanocomposites were characterized. The most important finding is that although there is firm evidence showing the formation of a nanocomposite structure, the tensile modulus, and loss and storage modulus exhibit a progressively decreasing trend with increasing clay concentration. In addition, the rate of thermal degradation is slightly but progressively hastened upon formation of a nanocomposite. These trends have been explained on the basis of a progressive decrease in the degree of crosslinking with increasing clay concentration. While this explanation is reasonable, we note that lack of detailed knowledge of the structure of the polyester resin prevents a more detailed explanation and therefore, it is more of a hypothesis than fact. Oxygen permeability in the matrices was found progressively reduced with increasing clay concentration, in keeping with the increase in the tortuous path for a diffusing penetrant. The barrier properties were found to correlate well with the observed morphology. The reduction in the loss and storage modulus, tensile modulus and oxygen permeability values at the 2.5 wt% clay concentration was found to be greater compared to that seen at higher concentrations. This behavior was traced to the exfoliation occurring at a more global scale in the 2.5 wt% case presumably leading to a greater drop in the degree of crosslinking. However, we do not discount the possibility of other sources that could account for this property reduction, such as the clay-modifier-polymer interface and the chemical effects of the organic modifier on the matrix resin. Establishing the morphological hierarchy in polymer-clay nanocomposites is demonstrated to be the key factor in developing an understanding of structure-property relationships in these systems. "
1272,Suitability of novel galactomannans as edible coatings for tropical fruits.xml,['abstract']," The main objective of this work was to determine the optimal composition of edible coatings in view of their application to extend the shelf life of several tropical fruits. Coatings constituted by galactomannans from different sources (Caesalpinia pulcherrima and Adenanthera pavonina) and glycerol were characterized as coatings for five tropical fruits: acerola (Malpighia emarginata), cajá (Spondias lutea), mango (Mangifera indica), pitanga (Eugenia uniflora) and seriguela (Spondias purpurea). The surface properties of the five fruits were determined and different aqueous galactomannan solutions (0.5% , 1.0% and 1.5% ) with glycerol (1.0% , 1.5% and 2.0% ) were tested for their wettability on fruits. For the solutions having a better wettability, films were casted and water vapour permeability, oxygen permeability, carbon dioxide permeability, tensile strength and elongation at break were determined. Taking into account the surface and permeability properties of the obtained films, four compositions were selected as the best coatings to the studied fruits: acerola-0.5% of A. pavonina galactomannan and 1.0% of glycerol; cajá-1.0% of A. pavonina galactomannan and 1.0% of glycerol; mango and pitanga-1.5% of A. pavonina galactomannan and 1.0% of glycerol; and seriguela-0.5% of C. pulcherrima galactomannan and 1.5% of glycerol. For the coating, the values of the measured properties were as follows: wettability ranged from-36.33±3.39 to-26.45±4.58 mN m^-1; water vapour permeability ranged from 4.89±0.11 to 6.25±0.20 × 10^-11 g m^-1 s^-1 Pa^-1; oxygen permeability ranged from 0.31±0.01 to 0.99±0.13 × 10^-15 g m (Pa s m^2)^-1; carbon dioxide permeability ranged from 28.81±3.08 to 61.19±1.44 × 10^-15 g m (Pa s m^2)^-1; tensile strength ranged from 2.56±0.15 to 3.96±0.43 MPa; and elongation at break ranged from 28.26±4.53% to 46.36±2.29% .

1278,Suitability of novel galactomannans as edible coatings for tropical fruits.xml,['Introduction']," During the last decades, there has been an increasing demand for fresh fruits and vegetables forcing the food industry to develop new and better methods for maintaining food quality and extending shelf life. Great losses (from 20% to 80% ) in the quality of fresh fruits occur from harvesting to final consumption and the fruits short shelf life is an important drawback concerning distribution chains. On the other hand, consumers around the world demand food of high quality, without chemical preservatives and with extended shelf life. As a consequence, an increased effort has been made to discover new natural preservatives and antimicrobials (Chien et al., 2007). Packaging plays a decisive role in the improvement of fruits’ shelf life and new packaging materials are being developed, most of them are derived from renewable resources (Lin and Zhao, 2007). Edible coatings act by creating a modified atmosphere surrounding the commodity, similar to that achieved by controlled or modified atmospheric storage conditions. The modified atmosphere created by edible coatings protects the food from the moment it is applied until it reaches the final consumer (Diab et al., 2001, Durango et al., 2006, Ribeiro et al., 2007). Several researchers studied the application of coatings in fruits such as apples (Rojas-Grau et al., 2007), strawberries (Mali and Grossmann, 2003, Tanada-Palmu and Grosso, 2005, Ribeiro et al., 2007), mango (Srinivasa et al., 2002, Chien et al., 2007, Dang et al., 2008) and kiwi (Xu et al., 2001). Polysaccharide-based coatings are colourless and have an oil-free appearance, and can be used to increase the shelf life of fruits, vegetables, shellfish or meat products to avoid dehydration, and to reduce the oxidative rancidity and darkening of the surface to some extent. Other characteristics that make them attractive are their transport properties (permeability to CO2, O2 and water vapour), the reduction of materials weight loss and the reduction of the microbial spoilage of the fruits (Petersen et al., 1999, Dang et al., 2008). However, the effectiveness of edible coatings for fruits preservation depends, in a first stage, on the control of the wettability of the coating in order to ensure a uniformly coated surface. Other factors also affect the effectiveness of the coating, such as transport (permeability) and mechanical properties; these must also be considered in order to:•Decrease the water loss in the fruits (i.e., lower water vapour permeability values).•Decrease the O2 permeability (i.e., lower O2 permeability values) as a lower O2 concentration prolongs the shelf life by delaying the oxidative breakdown of the complex substrates (Farber et al., 2003), and reduce the production of ethylene, a key element of the ripening and maturation process (Lee et al., 1996, Zagory, 1995).•Increase the shelf life of fruits, by increasing the lag-phase and generation time during the logarithmic growth phase of spoilage microorganisms (Farber et al., 2003, Phillips, 1996), which is accomplished by keeping high CO2 permeability values.•Improve the mechanical resistance of the films / coatings in order to preserve their integrity as much as possible during the fruits’ shelf life. Decrease the water loss in the fruits (i.e., lower water vapour permeability values). Decrease the O2 permeability (i.e., lower O2 permeability values) as a lower O2 concentration prolongs the shelf life by delaying the oxidative breakdown of the complex substrates (Farber et al., 2003), and reduce the production of ethylene, a key element of the ripening and maturation process (Lee et al., 1996, Zagory, 1995). Increase the shelf life of fruits, by increasing the lag-phase and generation time during the logarithmic growth phase of spoilage microorganisms (Farber et al., 2003, Phillips, 1996), which is accomplished by keeping high CO2 permeability values. Improve the mechanical resistance of the films / coatings in order to preserve their integrity as much as possible during the fruits’ shelf life. Galactomannans are present in the endosperm of numerous plants, particularly the Leguminosae, and they have several functions, including being a reserve of carbohydrates (Reid and Edwards, 1995). Galactomannans are polysaccharides built up of a β-(1-4)-d-mannan backbone with single d-galactose branches linked α-(1-6). Their mannose / galactose (M / G) ratios differ according to the species (Kök et al., 1999). Galactomannans can often be used in different forms for human consumption. Featuring different physicochemical properties, galactomannans are a versatile material used for many applications: they are excellent stiffeners and stabilizers of emulsions, and the absence of toxicity allows their use in the textile, pharmaceutical, biomedical, cosmetics and food industries (Srivastava and Kapoor, 2005, Vieira et al., 2007). In this work, coatings of galactomannans from two plant species (Adenanthera pavonina and Caesalpinia pulcherrima) were evaluated. A. pavonina, a plant from the Leguminosae family, native from tropical Asia, is used in reforestation and as an ornamental plant and is also an important source of wood. C. pulcherrima is also a plant from the Leguminosae family being found throughout India and other regions of the globe where it is used as an ornamental plant. Galactomannan from A. pavonina presents a ratio mannose / galactose of 1.35, while the galactomannan obtained by C. pulcherrima seeds presents a ratio mannose / galactose of 2.88 (Cerqueira et al., 2009). These polysaccharides are a cheap alternative to the existing (mostly synthetic) substances and have the advantage of being produced locally, near the harvesting sites of the studied fruits. The development of these applications from natural products and their use in the production sites to increase the fruits’ shelf life can be an important contribution to the economy of countries such as Brazil. This work aims at assessing the suitability of galactomannans from seeds of A. pavonina and C. pulcherrima to be used as edible coatings for different tropical fruits: acerola (Malpighia glabra), cajá (Spondias lutea), mango (Mangifera indica), pitanga (Eugenia uniflora) and seriguela (Spondias purpurea) and to determine which formulation is the most adequate to coat these fruits. This has been done by evaluating the fruits’ surface properties following the application of different coatings (formed by mixtures of each of the polysaccharides at different concentrations and plasticizer) and by optimizing the composition of the coating in terms of its wettability and permeability properties. To evaluate the mechanical properties of the selected coatings the tensile strength and elongation at break were measured. "

The polysaccharide extraction was performed as described in Cerqueira et al. (2009). The seeds were removed from the pods, cleaned and placed in a blender, where they were mechanically broken. Following this, the endosperm was manually separated from the germ and the hull and was suspended in ethanol (purity 99.8% , Riedel-de Haën, Germany) at 70 °C for 15 min.

The blended suspension was filtered through a nylon net followed by a centrifugation step at 3800 g (Sigma 4 K, B. Braun, Germany) for 20 min at 20 °C.

The number of replications is specified when describing each of the methodologies used. The concentrations were chosen based on preliminary experiments (data not shown) where it was determined that for galactomannan contents above 1.5% (w / v) their dissolution was extremely difficult; also for glycerol, previous studies indicated that a maximum of 2.0% would be necessary, while for values lower than 0.5% the film would be too brittle.

1282,Suitability of novel galactomannans as edible coatings for tropical fruits.xml,"['Materials and methods', 'Critical surface tension of fruits skins']"," According to Zisman (1964), in systems having a surface tension lower than 100 mN m^-1 (low-energy surfaces), the contact angle formed by a drop of liquid on a solid surface will be a linear function of the surface tension of the liquid, γLV, (where phase V is air saturated with the vapour of liquid, L). The Zisman method is applicable only for low-energy surfaces; therefore it is necessary to determine the surface energy of the fruits. For a pure liquid, if polar (γLP) and dispersive (γLd) interactions are known, and if θ is the contact angle between that liquid and a solid, the interaction can be described in terms of the reversible work of adhesion, Wa, as:(1)Wa=Wad+Wap⇔Wa=2 γSd γLd+γSp γLpwhere γSP and γSd are the polar and dispersive contributions of the surface of the studied solid. Rearranging Eq. (1), yields:(2)1+cosθ2 γLγLd=γSp γLpγLd+γSd The contact angle determinations (please see Section 2.5) of at least three pure compounds: bromonaphthalene (Merck, Germany), formamide (Merck, Germany) and ultra pure water, on the surface of the fruit (fruit skin) combined with the each dispersive and polar component value, will allow the calculation of both the independent variable, γLpγLd, and the dependent variable, 1+cosθ2 γLγLd, from Eq. (2). The surface tension, the dispersive and the polar component were, respectively, 72.10, 19.90 and 52.20 mN m^-1 for water, 44.40, 44.40 and 0.00 mN m^-1 for bromonaphthalene and 56.90, 23.50 and 33.40 mN m^-1 for formamide (Busscher et al., 1984). The estimation of the critical surface tension (γC) was performed by extrapolation from Zisman plots (Zisman, 1964). Zisman plots have long been used to characterize the wettability of low-energy surfaces. Zisman plots are obtained by plotting the cosine of the contact angle of pure liquids on a solid surface to be studied against the surface tension of the same series of liquids. The intercept of these curves with cos θ = 1 is known as the critical surface tension (γC). The critical surface tension is an imaginary point of the γsv value and it is frequently used to describe the wettability of a surface. It represents the value of γLV of a liquid above which the spreading of this liquid in a solid surface is complete. The critical surface tension (γC) is defined as:(3)γC=limγLVasθ→0 "
1283,Suitability of novel galactomannans as edible coatings for tropical fruits.xml,"['Materials and methods', 'Wettability']"," The wettability was studied by determining the values of the spreading coefficient (Ws) and the works of adhesion (Wa) and cohesion (Wc). The adhesive forces promote the liquid spreading in a solid surface and the cohesive forces promote their contraction. The wetting behaviour of the solutions will mainly depend on the balance between these forces. The surface tension of the coating solution was measured by the pendant drop method using the Laplace-Young approximation (Song and Springer, 1996). The contact angle (θ) of a liquid drop on a solid surface is defined by the mechanical equilibrium of the drop under the action of three interfacial tensions: solid-vapour (γSV), solid-liquid (γSL), and liquid-vapour (γLV). The equilibrium spreading coefficient (Ws) is defined by Eq. (4) (Rulon and Robert, 1993) and can only be negative or zero:(4)Ws=Wa-Wc=γSV-γLV-γSL.where Wa and Wc are the works of adhesion and cohesion, defined by Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively(5)Wa=γLV+γSV-γSL(6)Wc=2 γLV. Contact angle (θ) and liquid-vapour surface tension (γLV) were measured in a face contact angle meter (OCA 20, Dataphysics, Germany). The samples of the coatings were taken with a 500 μL syringe (Hamilton, Switzerland), with a needle of 0.75 mm of diameter. The contact angle at the fruit surfaces was measured by the sessile drop method (Newman and Kwok, 1999), in which a droplet of the tested liquid was placed on a horizontal surface and was observed with a face contact angle meter. Measurements were made in less than 30 s. Ten replicates of contact angle and surface tension measurements were obtained at 21.3±0.5 °C. "

Steady-state and uniform water pressure conditions were assumed by maintaining the air circulation constant outside the test cell by using a miniature fan inside the desiccator (McHugh et al., 1993). The slope of weight loss versus time was obtained by a linear regression. Three replicates were obtained for each sample. "

The films were sealed between two chambers, having each one two channels. In the lower chamber O2 (or CO2) was supplied at a controlled (J & W Scientific, ADM 2000, USA) flow rate to maintain its pressure constant in that compartment. The other chamber was purged by a stream of nitrogen, also at controlled flow. Nitrogen acted as a carrier for the O2 (or the CO2). In the case of O2P measurement, the flow leaving this chamber was connected to an O2 sensor (Mettler Toledo, Suisse) which measured the O2 concentration in that flow on-line. In the case of CO2P measurement the flow leaving this chamber was collected in a syringe for CO2 quantification. To determine CO2 concentration, 1 mL of sample was injected in a gas chromatograph (Chrompack 9001, Middelburg, Netherlands) at 110 °C with a column Porapak Q 80 / 100 mesh 2 m × 1 / 8″ × 2 mm SS, using a flame ionization detector (FID) at 110 °C. Helium at 23 mL min^-1 was used as carrier gas. A standard mixture containing 10% CO2, 20% O2 and 70% N2 was used for calibration. The flows of the two chambers were connected to a manometer to ensure the equality of pressures (both at 1 atm) between both compartments. As the O2 (and the CO2) was carried continuously by the nitrogen flow, it was considered that partial pressure of O2 (and the CO2) in the upper compartment is null, therefore ΔP is equal to 1 atm. Three replicates were obtained for each sample, in each case (O2P and CO2P). "

1289,Suitability of novel galactomannans as edible coatings for tropical fruits.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Surface tension and critical surface tension of fruits skins']"," The surface tension of the fruits is very similar, but there are differences between the polar and the dispersive components (Table 1). All the fruits present a higher dispersive component, which shows the ability of the fruit surface to participate in non-polar interactions. This was also demonstrated by Ribeiro et al. (2007) in strawberry, where the dispersive component was higher than the polar component. A surface with these characteristics interacts with liquid primarily by dispersion forces that can influence the effective spreading of the coating on the surface of the fruits: the compatibility of the polarity (apolar or polar) of the surface and of the coating may play therefore an important role in the wettability of a surface by a liquid and may condition the composition of the latter. In the present work, the fruits presenting the higher values of polar interactions were acerola and seriguela, while mango displayed the lowest value of the polar component, therefore presenting the lowest ability to participate in polar interactions. These differences, despite being statistically significant, are presumably not sufficient to impose a very different behaviour of the surface towards the coating solution. This hypothesis is supported by the results presented in, e.g. Table 2, where no clear difference is shown between the values of Ws for the fruits and coatings evaluated in this work. Table 1 also shows the value of the critical surface tension obtained for each fruit, which varies between 9.39 and 23.92 mN m^-1. Acerola presented the lowest value and cajá the highest. The obtained values are close to the critical surface tension of the apple (18.70 mN m^-1) and of the orange (20.00 mN m^-1) presented by Choi et al. (2002), exception made to acerola and pitanga that present a lower value. Also, the values of the critical surface tension must be lower than the values of the surface tension (Dann, 1970), which holds true for all the fruits used in this study. In all cases, it is possible to conclude that the studied fruits have low-energy surfaces (i.e., below 100 mN m^-1) meaning that the Zisman method is applicable. "

The wettability was studied by determining the values of the spreading coefficient (Ws). The spreading coefficient (Ws) of the solutions of galactomannans and glycerol applied on each fruit was analysed and presented in Table 2, Table 3. For each fruit, the best (higher) value of Ws for the respective galactomannan was determined (Tukey test, p < 0.05) and is filled in gray. When no statistically significant differences between galactomannan solutions are observed, it has been assumed that both were equally good in terms of wettability and that their differentiation must be made based on other criteria (such as permeability to gases, which will be presented subsequently). The results show that the values of Ws are quite dependent on both the source and concentration of galactomannan and the fruit tested. The solutions with lower values of A. pavonina (AP) galactomannan concentration present better (higher) values (p < 0.05) of Ws for those fruits with higher values of the polar component (acerola and seriguela). In the case of C. pulcherrima galactomannan the better value of Ws in mango (lower polar component) was achieved for a galactomannan concentration of 1.5% . These results are related to the polarity of the aqueous solutions; with the increase in the galactomannan concentration the polarity of the solutions decreases rendering them more able to coat non-polar surfaces (such mango surface). Table 2 displays the values of Ws obtained using the galactomannan of (AP). Acerola presents the best value of Ws when coated with solutions containing 0.5% galactomannan and 1.0% glycerol, seriguela presents the best value with the same concentration of galactomannan and 1.5% of glycerol. For mango, pitanga and cajá solutions with 0.5% , 1.0% and 1.5% of galactomannan do not show a statistically significant difference, presenting good values of Ws for the different concentrations of galactomannan and glycerol used. When the galactomannan of C. pulcherrima (CP) was used, the values of Ws (Table 3) present statistically significant differences for each fruit; a single solution was found in each case, having the lower value of Ws. In all cases, with the exception of mango (the best Ws value was obtained with 1.5% of galactomannan) the best value of Ws was obtained with solutions containing 0.5% of galactomannan. The best coatings of A. pavonina and C. pulcherrima in terms of wettability (represented by the spreading coefficient-Ws) were subsequently analysed for water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability, according to the below mentioned criteria.

1297,Suitability of novel galactomannans as edible coatings for tropical fruits.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Water vapour permeability (WVP)']"," The water vapour permeability is the most extensively studied property of edible films mainly because of the importance of the water in deteriorative reactions. Table 4 shows that the values of WVP change with the use of different concentrations of glycerol in the galactomannan solutions as for higher concentrations of glycerol an increase in WVP occurs. These differences are statistically significant when the plasticizer concentration is increased from 1.0% to 2.0% . Gontard et al. (1993) explained that the effect of glycerol can be attributed to the hydrophilic properties of this compound which favour the adsorption of water molecules. Glycerol, through its plasticizing action, changes the polymer network creating mobile regions with larger interchain distances, promoting water clustering by competing with water at active sites of the polymer matrix and the formation of microcavities in the polymer network structure (Diab et al., 2001). The increase in WVP of edible films supported by increasing concentration of plasticizer has also been reported to happen in starch-based films (Mali et al., 2006), pullulan films (Diab et al., 2001), wheat gluten films (Gontard et al., 1993, Cherian et al., 1995), cellulose based films (Park and Chinnan, 1995) locust bean gum films (Aydinli and Tutas, 2000) and sodium caseinate / starch blends (Arvanitoyannis and Biliaderis, 1998). An increase in the concentration of AP and CP galactomannans, for the same concentration of glycerol, corresponds to a decrease in WVP, possibly due a stronger gel network, where the polysaccharide molecules are closer, forming a more cohesive film structure. These changes present statistically significant differences when increasing of galactomannan concentration from 0.5% to 1.5% (Table 4). The formulations featuring lower values of WVP were: 0.5% CP-1.0% Gly, 1.5% CP-2.0% Gly, 0.5% AP-1.0% Gly, 1.0% AP-1.0% Gly and 1.5% AP-1.0 Gly. The WVP values obtained for the galactomannans films are in agreement with those reported for other galactomannan and polysaccharide films. Aydinli and Tutas (2000) obtained WVP values ranging between 3.2 and 1.8 (10^-11 g m^-1 s^-1 Pa^-1) for films of locust bean gum (≈1.0% w / v) with polyethylene glycol (≈0.4% and 1.7% (v / v)). In other work, corn starch-based films (5% ) with glycerol (1.4% ) presented a WVP value of 8.7 (10^-11 g m^-1 s^-1 Pa^-1) (Garcia et al., 2006). "

1300,Suitability of novel galactomannans as edible coatings for tropical fruits.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Oxygen permeability (O2P)']"," Oxygen is the key factor for oxidation, which is responsible for changes in food odour, colour, flavour and nutrients deterioration. Therefore, films that provide a proper oxygen barrier can help in improving food quality and extending food shelf life. Table 4 presents the O2P as measured for the selected coatings of AP and CP. It is known that the increase in galactomannan concentration contributes to the decrease of permeability, while it is normally accepted that a higher concentration of glycerol increases O2P (as it does with WVP, as shown before) (Caner et al., 1998, Kester and Fennema, 1986). In general, the samples with higher concentration of plasticizer have higher values of O2P than the samples with a lower plasticizer concentration. These results can be explained by the apolar nature of the oxygen molecule that does not interact with the polar properties of the glycerol molecule, increasing the film permeability to the oxygen. Similar results were also obtained by Caner et al. (1998) and Kester and Fennema (1986) as the plasticizer decreases the intermolecular attractions between polymeric chains, facilitating the penetration of gas molecules. In the present case, the effect of the galactomannan source seems to have surpassed the effect of glycerol concentration, having statistically significant differences been found between O2P from films of AP and CP galactomannan. These differences might be explained by the different polymer chain constitution of the two galactomannans; AP galactomannan has a mannose / galactose ratio lower than that of CP galactomannan: 1.35 and 1.85, respectively (Mikkonen et al., 2007, Cerqueira et al., 2009). The lowest values of O2P were obtained with three formulations: 1.0% AP-1.0% Gly, 1.5% AP-1.0% Gly and 1.5% AP-1.5% Gly. "

Table 4 shows CO2P values for the tested polysaccharide solutions. The results seem to indicate that solutions with a higher concentration of plasticizer produce films with a lower value of CO2P. The effect of glycerol concentration seems to be, by far, the most important one affecting CO2P. An opposite effect of glycerol concentration has been noticed for WVP and O2P; those films showing a lower O2P are the ones that show a higher CO2P. When glycerol concentration increases the WVP and O2P increased and CO2P decreased probably as a result of the polar and hydrogen-bonding properties of the glycerol molecule. The highest value of CO2P was obtained with the formulation: 1.5% AP-1.0% Gly. Based on the previously presented criteria-high values of wettability, low water vapour permeability, a low O2P and a high CO2P-the following coating / film compositions were chosen to be the most adequate for each fruit: acerola-0.5% AP and 1.0% Gly; cajá-1.0% AP and 1.0% Gly; mango and pitanga-1.5% AP and 1.0% Gly; and seriguela-0.5 CP and 1.5 Gly (filled in gray in Table 4).

Fig. 1 shows that the values of TS increase with the increase in galactomannan concentrations for AP films. Comparing the TS values between films from AP and CP, Fig. 1 shows that the films of CP with a concentration of 0.5% of galactomannan and 1.5% of glycerol are not statistically different (p > 0.05) from AP films with concentrations of 1.5% of galactomannan and 1.0% of glycerol; this may be due to the less substituted structure of the galactomannan of CP (mannose / galactose ratio of 2.88) when compared with the structure of AP (mannose / galactose ratio of 1.35); due to its less branched nature, the former may be more prone to establish intermolecular bonds than the latter, therefore providing a film with similar TS values despite the lower galactomannan concentration. Similar results were obtained by Mikkonen et al. (2007) when comparing the TS of locust bean gum (mannose / galactose ration of 3.5) and guar gum (mannose / galactose ration of 1.5) films. The CP film presents the higher value of E (Fig. 2), which may be explained by the higher content of glycerol, but also by the more flexible, less substituted structure of the CP galactomannan when compared to that of the AP galactomannan; however, from the data it is not possible to conclude which of the two effects is the one most influencing the E value. A similar trend has been reported by Mikkonen et al. (2007), who have shown that locust bean gum films are more flexible than the guar gum films. The obtained values are in agreement with other reported studies that use polysaccharide films. Srinivasa et al. (2007) showed that chitosan films, with glycerol as plasticizer, have values of 14.14 MPa and 34.00% , for TS and E, respectively. Garcia et al. (2006) showed that films with different ratios of corn starch, chitosan and glycerol have values ranging from 60.7 to 7.1 MPa for TS and values ranging between 22.5 and 3.0% for E, with the film formed by corn starch and glycerol presenting TS and E values closer to the films of galactomannan.

All fruits were shown to have the ability to participate in non-polar interactions, as a consequence of the higher values of the dispersive component of the surface tension. Different formulations of galactomannan and glycerol showed good values of Ws, being the best values related to the dispersive component of the fruits´ surface. The best coating formulation for each of the studied fruits was: acerola-0.5% of A. pavonina and 1.0% of glycerol; cajá-1.0% of A. pavonina and 1.0% of glycerol; mango and pitanga-1.5% of A. pavonina and 1.0% of glycerol; and seriguela-0.5% of C. pulcherrima and 1.5% of glycerol. These formulations should be either applied by immersion or sprayed on the fruits and let dry at room temperature during 3 h. It has been shown that these novel galactomannan extracted from AP and CP can be applied on the studied fruits based on their surface properties. Future work should include shelf-life studies in order to demonstrate the positive expected effects of the application of these coatings on the fruits: shelf-life extension with improved sensory quality.

Polyurethanes possess good mechanical properties such as high abrasion resistance, tear strength, flexibility and elasticity. However, they show poor thermal stability and barrier property, which can be modified by clay [2]. Since polyurethane / clay nanocomposite was introduced by Pinnavaia [3], many polyurethane / clay nanocomposite studies have been carried out [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. However, some studies was carried out with organoclays treated with the organifiers consisted of alkyl chains [5], [8], [9] and these organoclays are not stable in DMF which is widely used in polyurethane coatings. In this study, we synthesized the organifier which had urethane group in the backbone and relatively high molecular weight to enlarge d-spacing; had hydroxyl end-group to react with isocyanate during polyurethane reaction. In addition, the clay treated with the organifier was stable in DMF suspension for a long period of time. The polyurethane / clay nanocomposites were synthesized with controlling the dispersibility of organoclay in polyurethane matrix. The effect of the dispersibility of organoclay on the properties of polyurethane / clay nanocomposites such as the morphology, barrier property, thermal stability and tensile properties was investigated.

TEM micrographs were obtained by using a Philips CM20 Transmission electron microscopy. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction was conducted at ambient temperature on Rigaku D / MAX-RC diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation to measure the d-spacing of organoclays. Each sample was scanned from 2θ=1.2 to 10 ° at a scan rate of 2 ° / min. Glass transition temperature was measured by using a Rheometric Scientific DMTA IV. DMTA experiments were made at a fixed frequency of 1 Hz with a heating rate of 5 °C / min over a temperature range of-100 to 100 °C in rectangular tension / compression mode. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed under nitrogen atmosphere by using a TA Instruments TGA Q500 to measure the ion exchange fraction of organoclay and the thermal stability of polyurethane and polyurethane / clay nanocomposites. The measurement was carried out with a heating rate of 20 °C / min in the temperature range from 50 to 900 °C. The ion-exchange fraction is defined as the fraction that active sites on layered silicates are exchanged for the organifier by a cation exchange reaction. Since the absorbed water vaporizes below 120 °C, the difference of the weight loss between 120 and 900 °C is assumed to be the content of organifier and structural water in organoclay. The content of structural water in pristine montmorillonite was measured to be 6.91 wt% which was estimated from the weight loss by heating Cloisite^®Na^+ from 120 to 900 °C [15]. Therefore, we could calculate both the inorganic content including the content of structural water and the content of organifier in organoclay. The ion-exchanged fraction could be calculated by dividing the CEC of montmorillonite (in this study, 92.6 mequiv. / 100 g) into the organifier content (mmol / 100 g montmorillonite) [15]. Gas permeability was measured by high vacuum time-lag method [17]. The permeation apparatus is shown in Fig. 2. After introducing oxygen to the upstream side(1.45 atm), an increase in pressure at the initially evacuated downstream side was measured as a function of time with a pirani vacuum gauge (GP-1SRY, ULVAC Inc., Japan). The measurement was repeated 2-4 times to obtain the permeability of oxygen. The measurement temperature was 30 °C. Tensile tests were carried out with the Instron 5583 machine according to ASTM D638M. The specimen with 6 mm width and the grip distance of 25 mm was used and the crosshead speed was 500 mm / min. "

The PU nanocomposites without sonication, PU / CL-UE400S00, showed large size clay particles ranging from 10 to 100 μm as shown in Fig. 4(a). Because clay aggregates could be broken into fine clay particles by the sonication, small clay particles ranging from 0.5 to 10 μm were shown in PU / CL-UE400S60 as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c). Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns for Cloisite^®Na^+ and CL-UE400. The d-spacing of pristine montmorillonite was increased by introducing the organifier from 1.18 nm (2θ=7.48 °) to 2.29 nm (2θ=3.86 °). The inorganic content of CL-UE400 was 53.7 wt% and the molecular weight of UE400 was 1255.54 g / mol, so the ion-exchanged fraction of CL-UE400 was found to be 0.747. This value meant that 74.4% of Na cation on layered silicate was exchanged for the organifier via cation exchange reaction. Despite relatively high molecular weight of the organifier, CL-UE400 had high ion-exchanged fraction and it results from the urethane groups of the organifier which can form hydrogen bonding with the oxygen atoms (-Si-O-Si-) on the surface of silicate layers [18], so the layered silicates can be more treated with the organifier UE400. However, the PEG chains in UE400 and layered silicate experience an attractive interaction due to their hydrophilic characteristics, so the overall conformation of UE400 between silicate layers is rather flat [19]. Therefore, the enlarged d-spacing was only 1.11 nm despite relatively high molecular weight of the organifier and high ion-exchanged fraction of CL-UE400. The effect of chemical structure of organifier on the properties of organoclay such as d-spacing will be the topic of a forthcoming paper [20]. XRD patterns of PU / CL-UE400S00 and S60 are shown in Fig. 6. The d-spacing of polyurethane / clay nanocomposites was 2.61-2.66 nm (2θ=3.32-3.38 °). Generally, the d-spacing of organoclay in polymer nanocomposites depends on the preparation method of nanocomposites [21], and the interaction between polymer matrix and organoclay [22]. In the case of PU / CL-UE400S00 and S60, sonication was applied to the organoclay suspension in DMF prior to the polymerization of the nanocomposites and the nanocomposites were synthesized with the same materials and the preparation method. Therefore, the d-spacings of PU / CL-UE400S00 and S60 didn't show significant difference with varying the clay content and sonication. TEM micrographs of PU / CL-UE400S00 and S60 are shown in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, respectively. In Fig. 7, PU / CL-UE400S00, nanocomposites without sonication, showed that the thickness of the organoclay was ranging about 100-200 nm. However, in Fig. 8, after the sonication the aggregate organoclays were broken into fine clay particles. Therefore, PU / CL-UE400S60 showed better dispersibility of organoclay in polyurethane matrix. In high magnification, it was found that the intercalated structure with some disorder was formed in both PU / CL-UE400S00 and S60 nanocomposites. "

The hydroxyl end-groups of organifier can react with isocyanates during polymerization [7], so the organifier can act as a chain extender. By the sonication, clay aggregates can be broken into fine clay particles and more organifier can be exposed to the reaction medium during polymerization. Therefore, the molecular weight of PU / CL-UE400S60 is slightly higher than that of PU / CL-UE400S00 due to the increased amount of the exposed organifier with sonication.

Therefore, the glass transition temperature of the hard segment couldn't be determined. The peak of tanδ curve was determined as the glass transition temperature. The glass transition temperature increased with increasing the amount of clay. The Tg shift with increasing the clay content results from the confinement effect of clay to polyurethane molecules [11] and the strong interactions such as the hydrogen bonding between the urethane groups of polyurethane molecules and the oxygen atoms on the surface of silicate layers [18]; the chemical bonding from the reaction between organifiers and polyurethane molecules. The Tg shift was about 7 °C when 5 wt% of clay was added and there was no additional effect on Tg by the sonication. "

The onset temperature of degradation, the temperature of maximum decomposition rate for the first stage and that for the second stage are defined as TOD, Tmax,1 and Tmax,2, respectively. Generally, clay particles can enhance the thermal stability of polymer by acting as thermal insulator [25] and mass transport barrier to the volatile products generated during decomposition [26]. The effect of clay as thermal insulator and mass transport barrier on thermal stability can be increased with improving the dispersibility of organoclay, so Tmax,1 and Tmax,2 of PU / CL-UE400S60 was about 10 °C higher than those of PU / CL-UE400S00 due to good dispersibility of organoclay in PU / CL-UE400S60.

Therefore, Young's modulus increased with increasing the clay content and the dispersibility of organoclay. The largest increase in Young's modulus (1.7-fold) was shown at PU / CL-UE400S60 5 wt% . As mentioned above, there are two strong interactions between polyurethane matrix and layered silicates such as the hydrogen bonding [18] and the chemical bonding, so the tensile strength and elongation at break increased by introducing organoclay.

Above 3 wt% of organoclay, however, the tensile strength and elongation at break decreased due to the aggregation of organoclay in polyurethane matrix.

1341,Synthesis of chain-extended organifier and properties of polyurethane clay nanocomposites.xml,['Conclusion']," In this study, the morphology, thermal stability, barrier property and tensile properties of polyurethane / clay nanocomposites were investigated with controlling the dispersibility of organoclay in polyurethane matrix. The dispersion of organoclay in polyurethane matrix was achieved by applying the sonication to the suspension of organoclay in DMF. The aggregate clay particles ranging from 10 to 100 μm were broken into fine clay particles below 10 μm by the sonication. Therefore, PU / CL-UE400S60 had better dispersibility of organoclay than PU / CL-UE400S00. The d-spacing of organoclay was found to be 2.29 nm compared to 1.18 nm of Cloisite^®Na^+. The polyurethane / clay nanocomposites formed the intercalated structure with some disorder and their d-spacing was about 2.6-2.7 nm. The barrier property, thermal stability and tensile properties significantly increased with increasing the dispersibility of organoclay. Barrier property and thermal stability increased with increasing the clay content and the dispersibility of organoclay due to the organoclay acting as the mass transport barrier to oxygen molecules and volatile degraded products, respectively. The enhancement of Young's modulus was directly affected by the layered silicates and their dispersibility in polymer matrix, so Young's modulus increased with increasing the clay content and the dispersibility of organoclay. Tensile strength and elongation at break were enhanced by introducing organoclay and increasing the dispersibility of organoclay due to the strong interactions between polyurethane matrix and organoclay. These properties showed maximum at 1 wt% organoclay and decreased with increasing the clay content due to the aggregation of organoclay. "

1347,Synthesis of thermal and chemical resistant oxygen barrier starch with reinforcement of nano silicon carbide.xml,['Introduction']," In recent years, the development of organic-inorganic nanocomposites have attracted many researchers due to unexpected hybrid properties of these tailored materials derived from more than one components (Gangopadhyay and De, 2000, Lim et al., 2002, Weon et al., 2006). As the natural biopolymers such as starch, cellulose and chitin are cheap, abundant, biodegradable and renewable, hence, attempts have been made on blending these materials with other substances to prepare new materials with desired properties (Fischer, 2003, Huang et al., 2005, Ishiaku et al., 2002Padalkar et al., 2010, Pandey et al., 2005, Park et al., 2003, Sahoo and Rana, 2006, Szepes et al., 2005, Wu, 2003). Among the biopolymers, starch is a promising polymeric material because of its low cost, easy availability, renewability and degradability. It is composed of repeating 1,4-α-d-glocopyranosyl units; amylase and amylopectin depending upon plant resources, and stored as granules in plants. Starch has a lot of uses as thickener, water binder, emulsion stabilizer, gelling agent, coating sizing in paper and textile, adhesives, adsorbents, encapsulants and so many (Araujo-Farro et al., 2010, Biswas et al., 2006, Jasim et al., 2010). Starch offers a suitable substitute for petroleum-based plastics especially for short term packaging and disposable applications (Tianyi and Xiuzhi, 2000, Weber et al., 2002). Because of its sensitivity to water, starch has a severe limitation. Attempt has been made to blend starch with synthetic biodegradable polymers like, poly (glycolic acids) (PGA) (Kong, Wang, Gao, Liu, & Liu, 2011), poly (lactic acids) (PLA) (Ke & Sun, 2000), polycaprolactone (PCL) (Rosa et al., 2004a, Rosa et al., 2004b), polyhydroxybutyrate (PBH) (Rosa et al., 2004a, Rosa et al., 2004b), and poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) (Willett & Shogren, 2002). Among these polymers, the PLA has been studied extensively for tissue engineering (Salgado, Coutinho, & Reis, 2004), drug delivery (Tarvainen et al., 2002) and as a synthetic degradable polymers in human medicine (Vroman & Tighzert, 2009). Among the blends of starch with PCL and maleicanhydride grafted PCL, more degradability was noticed in the case of grafted PCL (Wu, 2003). Starch was blended with PHB and measured the change in glass transition temperature of the films for all proportions of PHB (Godbole, Gote, Latkar, & Chakrabarti, 2003). The immiscibility of starch with PHBV was investigated with synthesis of series of starch / PHBV blends (Reis et al., 2008). We have studied the oxygen permeability and flame retardancy properties of Polymethylmethacrylate / starch composites and suggested the composite materials for use in packaging industries (Kisku & Swain, 2012). Carvalho et al. mixed the starch with natural rubber blends and developed a biodegradable starch-based plastic having high toughness (Carvalho, Job, Alves, Curvelo, & Gandini, 2003). A plenty of works are reported in the literatures regarding organic-inorganic based starch composites. Baczkowick et al. studied the thermal properties of Bi (III) and Bi(IV) complex materials of starch and found that, bismuthated starch were slightly less thermally stable than the raw starch (Baczkowicz, Wojtowicz, Anderegg, Schilling, & Tomasik, 2003). The glass transition and gas permeation properties of polyol-plasticised pullulan-starch blends were studied (Billaderis, Lazaridou, & Arvanitoyannis, 1999). Further, starch and semicarbazide hydrochloride were heated in the field of microwaves and it was noticed that the macrostructure of starch damaged on conventional heating where as degree of reaction was higher on the microwave heating (Siemion, Kapusniak, & Koziol, 2005). The porous scaffold of gelatin-starch-n hydroxyapatite composites was fabricated through microwave vacuum drying and crosslinking using trisodium citrate (Sundaram, Durance, & Wang, 2008). In another study (Vertuccio, Gorrasi, Sorrentino, & Vittoria, 2009) sodium montmorillonite was incorporated into poly (α-caprolactone)-starch blends by means of ball milling. It was observed that, the milling process not only has demonstrated to be a promising compatibilization method for immiscible PCL-starch blends, but it can also be used to improve the dispersion of nanoparticles in the polymer blends. In recent years, the modification of properties of starch based nanocomposites have become a growing interest as a promising option for developing their thermal, mechanical and gas barrier properties (Chen and Evans, 2005, Kalambur and Rizvi, 2004, Mc Gloshan and Hally, 2003). The biodegradable starch / clay nanocomposite films were developed and referred to be used as food packaging materials (Avella et al., 2005). The improvement of thermal and mechanical properties of biopolymers due to incorporation of nano fillers has been thoroughly reviewed (Shenhar et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2007). Fillers are particles of organic / inorganic origin that are added to modify mechanical, optical, electrical, thermal, gas barrier and flammability property of the matrix. Nano fillers having particle size between 1 to 100 nm have attracted a lot of attention world wide due to their high aspect ratio. Among nano fillers, silicon carbide is an important and non-oxide ceramic material having diversified industrial applications due to its exclusive properties such as, high melting point, oxidation resistance, high erosion resistance, high hardness, strength, chemical and thermal stability (Saravanan, Subramanian, Vishnu Kumar, & Tharanathan, 2006). Silicon carbide can occur in more than 250 crystalline forms called polytypes and has attracted much attraction these days as it has a good match of chemical, mechanical and thermal properties, that makes it a semiconductor of choice for harsh environment applications including high radiation exposure, operation in high temperature and corrosive media (Guo et al., 2008). The effect of nanometer SiC filler on Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) was studied for improvement of tribological behaviors (Wang, Xue, Liu, & Chen, 2000). Although there are numerous numbers of works are reported on starch based composites, still the synthesis of starch nanocomposites reinforced by nano SiC is limited in the literature. So it was a motivation to prepare bionanocomposites made of starch reinforced with silicon carbide in order to improve the thermal, chemical and oxygen barrier properties. In the present study, a series of starch / SiC bionanocomposites were synthesized by low cost green solution method where water was taken as the solvent. The bionanocomposites were characterized by FTIR, XRD and FESEM. The uniform distribution of SiC was achieved in order to reduce the oxygen permeability with enhancement of thermal and chemical resistant properties. "

Different weight percentage solution of silicon carbide was made with double distilled water by stirring SiC at 80 °C for 30 min and then passing ultra sound for 30 min using the same instrument. Then the starch solution was added to different wt% silicon carbide solutions.

The peaks at 3174 cm^-1, 1672 cm^-1 and 1170-1072 cm^-1 are assigned to the vibrational absorption of CH bond, intramolecular hydrogen bond and CO bond in starch respectively. The peaks at 995 cm^-1, 937 cm^-1 and 867 cm^-1 are due to vibrational absorption peaks of CH bond of starch. Silicon carbide has a strong absorption peak at 860 cm^-1 due to stretching vibration of SiC bond. However, the peak at 860 cm^-1 of SiC is appeared with less intensity in bionanocomposites. Similarly, the strong peak of starch at 3630 cm^-1 becomes weak and broad in the bionanocomposites. Therefore, there is an interaction of SiC with starch during the formation bionanocomposites. The FTIR spectra of bionanocomposites are noticed to be similar at all wt% of SiC. In the synthesized bionanocomposites, the characteristic peaks of starch and silicon carbide are present at about the same position with different intensities indicating the formation of composite (Saravanan et al., 2006).

In starch / SiC bionanocomposites, the characteristic peaks of starch and silicon carbide were found about the same region with different intensities indicating the formation of bionanocomposites. This was also evidenced by FESEM micrographs. The FESEM micrograph of starch, SiC, starch / SiC bionanocomposites of 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 wt% filler content were studied and compared in Fig. 3. The crystal structured starch flakes were noticed from the FESEM of starch. Further, in FESEM of SiC it was found that the average diameter of SiC nanopowder was found to be about 50 nm. The bionanocomposites at lower percentage (1 and 2 wt% ) of SiC, the particles were distributed and embedded in the starch matrix. However, the dispersion of SiC was improved with further increase in SiC (5, 8 and 10 wt% ). It was noticed that SiC nanopowder particles were completely dispersed in the starch matrix. The crystal structure of starch flakes was ruptured and partly disappeared in the FESEM picture of starch / SiC bionanocomposites having higher percentage of SiC. It may be due to better interfacial adhesion between starch and SiC during the formation of composites. "

1371,"Tensile, water vapor barrier and antimicrobial properties of PLA nanoclay composite films.xml",['Introduction']," The growth of environmental concerns over non-biodegradable petrochemical-based plastic packaging materials has raised interest in the use of biodegradable alternatives originating from renewable sources (Petersen et al., 1999, Weber et al., 2002). Among the renewable source-based biodegradable plastics, polylactides or poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is one of the most promising materials since it is thermoplastic, biodegradable, biocompatible and has high-strength, high-modulus and good processability (Drumright et al., 2000, Garlotta, 2001). PLA is a linear aliphatic thermoplastic polyester produced either by the polycondensation of lactic acid or by the ring opening polymerization of lactide. Lactide is a cyclic dimmer prepared by the controlled depolymerization of lactic acid, which is obtained from the fermentation of renewable sugar feedstock, such as corn or sugar beets (Tsuji, 2005). Due to high production costs, in the early stages of its development PLA was used in limited areas, such as preparation of medical devices (bone surgery, suture, and chemotherapy, etc.). Since production cost has been lowered by new technologies and large-scale production, the application of PLA has been extended to other commodity areas such as packaging, textiles and composite materials (Drumright et al., 2000, Garlotta, 2001). However, brittleness and other properties such as low thermal stability, medium gas barrier properties and low solvent resistance (e.g., against water) of the pure polymer are often insufficient for food packaging applications (Cabedo, Feijoo, Villanueva, Lagarón, & Giménez, 2006). The nanoscale distribution of nanoclays (such as montmorillonite, saponite or hectorite), with a high aspect ratio (100-1500) and extremely high surface-to-volume ratio (700-800 m^2 / g) established significant improvements to the polymer matrix in terms of mechanical, gas barrier, and optical properties at low filler content (less than 5% by weight) (Alexandre and Dubois, 2000, Brody, 2003, Giannelis, 1996, Pandey et al., 2005, Sinha Ray and Bousmina, 2005). To exploit the enhanced properties of such nanocomposite, various studies have been performed on the preparation of PLA-based nanocomposites (Liu et al., 2007, Maiti et al., 2002, Ogata et al., 1997, Sinha Ray et al., 2002, Sinha Ray and Okamoto, 2003, Sinha Ray et al., 2003). Although there are many publications on PLA-based nanocomposites, few works on PLA as an antimicrobial carrier for food and non-food packaging materials have been published yet. Recently, Rhim, Hong, Park, and Ng (2006) reported that some nanocomposite films prepared with a certain organically modified nanoclay had a strong antimicrobial function against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They postulated that the antimicrobial function of nanocomposite films could be attributed to the quaternary ammonium groups of organically modified clays. Antimicrobial nanocomposite films with enhanced properties such as mechanical and gas barrier properties have a high potential for being used as food packaging materials. The main objectives of this study were to prepare PLA / nanoclay composite films using a solvent casting method and to investigate the effect of the type of nanoclay and its concentration on the properties as well as antimicrobial activity of the prepared PLA-based composite films.

1381,"Tensile, water vapor barrier and antimicrobial properties of PLA nanoclay composite films.xml","['Results and discussion', 'Apparent film property']"," Flexible free-standing films were prepared with both PLA and PLA / clay composites by the solvent casting method. Previously, Rhim, Mohanty, et al. (2006) demonstrated through thermogravimetric analysis that the solvent cast PLA film contained about 13.7 g of solvent per 100 g of the film, which functioned as a plasticizer. The flexible films became stiffer after drying in the vacuum oven, which is probably due to removal of the remaining solvent in the film (Martin & Avérous, 2001). The thickness of the composite films increased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the control PLA film (Table 1), which is due to the increase in solid content. Percent transmittance of the PLA / nanoclay composite films decreased significantly after composite formation. However, the degree of decrease in the transmittance was strongly dependent on the clay types used. The difference in the transmittance of the PLA films may be due to the different miscibilities between clay and polymer matrix. In that sense, Cloisite 20A seems to be more compatible with PLA relative to other clays. In general, the optical property of a well-developed nanocomposite film is not significantly changed when the clay platelets with about 1 nm thickness are well dispersed through the polymer matrix, since such clay platelets with sizes less than the wavelength of visible light do not hinder light's passage (Zeng, Yu, Lu, & Paul, 2005). However, the large decrease in the transmittance of the composite films indirectly indicates that the clays are not completely dispersed in the polymer matrix. Another possible explanation for the decreased transparency of the composite films is due to the probable crystallization of solvent cast PLA films. Ogata et al. (1997) reported through thermal analysis that cold crystallization took place in the solvent cast PLA / clay nanocomposite and that the clay served as a nucleating agent. "

TS and E of pure PLA film were 50.5±0.8 MPa and 3.0±0.1% , respectively, which are comparable to those of thermocompressed PLA films (i.e., 44.0±2.2 MPa and 3.0±0.1% ) reported previously (Rhim, Mohanty, et al., 2006). On the contrary, TS and E of solvent cast PLA films containing solvent were 16.6±1.0 MPa and 203.4±20.8% , respectively (Rhim, Mohanty, et al., 2006). This is indirect evidence that the solvent does not work as a plasticizer in the PLA films, since it is removed during the post-drying process. Tensile test results indicate that the TS of the composite films decreased 10-20% depending on the nanoclay type. Usually, a well-developed polymer / clay nanocomposite results in highly increased mechanical strength compared to the pure polymer matrix since uniform dispersion of the nano-sized clay particles produces an ultra-high interfacial area and ionic bonds between the nanoclay and host polymer (Alexandre and Dubois, 2000, Pandey et al., 2005, Sinha Ray and Bousmina, 2005). However, compounding the montmorillonite clays reduced the TS in the present study, indicating that the organoclays are not well dispersed in the polymer matrix. Ogata et al. (1997) also prepared the solvent cast PLA / organoclay nanocomposite and found through small and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements that the silicate layers could not be individually well dispersed in the PLA / clay blend. Though the TS of PLA films decreased slightly after compounding with nanoclays, those of the composite films are still comparable to those of widely used plastic films such as high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS), of which the TS values are in the ranges of 22-31, 31-38, and 45-83 MPa, respectively (Hernandez, Selke, & Culter, 2000). The solvent cast PLA films became as brittle as the thermocompressed PLA films (Rhim, Mohanty, et al., 2006) after post-drying resulting in lower E values (Table 1). The mechanical strength of PLA / clay composite films can be tuned through proper choice of clay type and processing method to form an intercalation or exfoliation structure (Alexandre and Dubois, 2000, Giannelis, 1996). Among the nanoclays tested, Cloisite 20A was more effective in maintaining TS property than the other nanoclays, indicating that Cloisite 20A is more compatible with PLA, as compared to the other clays. "
1385,"Tensile, water vapor barrier and antimicrobial properties of PLA nanoclay composite films.xml","['Results and discussion', 'Effect of nanoclay type on WVP']"," The WVP values, along with actual RH conditions at the undersides of films during testing, of the PLA and PLA-based nanocomposite films are shown in Table 2. The WVP values of neat PLA and PLA / clay composite films are comparable to that of thermocompressed PLA films (2.61 × 10^-11 g m / m^2 s Pa), but much lower than that of solvent cast films (4.66 × 10^-11 g m / m^2 s Pa) (Rhim, Mohanty, et al., 2006). The WVP of nanocomposite films changed significantly (p < 0.05) depending on the type of nanoclays used. The WVP of nanocomposite films compounded with organically modified nanoclays, i.e., Cloisite 20A and 30B, decreased, while that of films composited with unmodified natural nanoclay, Cloisite Na^+, increased slightly. This result is mainly attributed to the hydrophobicity of organically modified nanoclays and hydrophilicity of unmodified nanoclay. Between the organically modified nanoclays, Cloisite 20A was more effective in reducing WVP than Cloisite 30B, since the former is more hydrophobic than the latter. This result also indicates that Cloisite 20A is more compatible with PLA polymer matrix relative to the other clays. The increase in water vapor barrier property of polymer / clay composite films is mainly attributed to the tortuous path for water vapor diffusion due to the impermeable clay layers distributed in the polymer matrix consequently increasing the effective diffusion path length (Cussler et al., 1998, Yano et al., 1997). In this study, we also noticed that the actual RH value at the inner film surface is close to 100% for both PLA films. This indicates that the water vapor pressure underneath the film can be considered to be similar to the water vapor pressure immediately above the water surface, therefore it is not necessary to account for stagnant air layer resistance between the film and water surface in the water vapor transmission rate measuring cups for PLA films (Rhim, Mohanty, et al., 2006).

The d001 peak of the clays was shifted to lower angle, corresponding to an increase in d-spacing to 3.14 and 3.23 nm for PLA / Cloisite 30B and PLA / Cloisite 20A nanocomposite samples, respectively. The higher basal spacings of clays in the nanocomposites, as compared to the pristine organoclays, are due to the intercalation of polymer chains inside the clay layers. The origin of other peaks around 2θ = 5.5 ° and 2θ = 5.2 ° for PLA / Cloisite 30B and PLA / Cloisite 20A, respectively, may be due to agglomerated organoclay particles and their weak compatibility with PLA. Careful inspection of the XRD patterns of the PLA / Cloisite 20A and the PLA / Cloisite 30B nanocomposites indicates that the Cloisite 20A exhibits better interaction with PLA than the Cloisite 30.

The transmittance of the composite films decreased linearly with increases in the clay content within the concentration range tested (Fig. 2). This is attributed to the hindrance of light passage by the stacked form of clays. Mechanical strength and ductility of the composite films increased slightly at low levels of clay content (2.5 pph), and decreased almost linearly with increases in the clay content (Fig. 3). This indicates the clay was dispersed more uniformly through polymer matrix at low concentrations (2.5 pph) to increase the surface attraction between the clay and the polymer matrix. Above this concentration, the attractive force between the clay and the polymer matrix was disturbed by the tactoid form of the clay. The WVP decreased significantly as the clay content increased as shown in Fig. 4. Many reports have provided evidence that gas barrier properties of polymer nanocomposite films decrease significantly with increases in clay content, as well as increases in the aspect ratio of clay (Cussler et al., 1998). The improved barrier property is mainly attributed to the increased path length due to the tortuous path of diffusion (Yano et al., 1997). "

In the preliminary test, organically modified clay powders, substituted with quaternary ammonium ions, especially Cloisite 30B, showed strong antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with small amounts of clay. However, when compounded with PLA, noticeable antimicrobial activity was not observed against all of the test microorganisms, regardless of clay types, except PLA / Cloisite 30B composite film (Fig. 5). As expected, pure PLA and PLA / Cloisite Na^+ films did not show any antimicrobial activity. Only PLA composite films compounded with Cloisite 30B showed bacteriostatic activity against L. monocytogenes. This result is not consistent with results previously reported by Rhim, Hong, et al. (2006), which found chitosan / Cloisite 30B composite films had strong antimicrobial action against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In this study the authors postulated that the antimicrobial action of the composite film was attributable to the polymer matrix itself (chitosan), solvent used for the preparation of the film (acetic acid), and the quaternary ammonium ions in the organically modified montmorillonite (Cloisite 30B). The main difference in antimicrobial activity between the chitosan / organoclay and the PLA / organoclay composite films might be also attributed to the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the polymer matrix, as well as organoclay used. Due to the hydrophobic nature of PLA, microorganisms cannot easily access the film; in consequence, no antimicrobial activity was observed in the PLA / clay composite films (Liu et al., 2007). "

The model succeeded in predicting the relative variation of O2, CO2 and N2 partial pressure in headspace and the growth of the studied microorganisms without any parameter identification. This work highlighted that the respiration of the targeted microorganism itself and / or that of the naturally present microflora could not be neglected in most of the cases, and could, in the particular case of aerobic microbes contribute to limit the growth by removing all residual O2 in the package. This work also confirmed the low sensitivity of L. monocytogenes toward CO2 while that of P. fluorescens permitted to efficiently prevent its growth by choosing the right combination of packaging gas permeability value and initial% of CO2 initially flushed in the pack.

1405,Validation of a predictive model coupling gas transfer and microbial growth in fresh food packed under modified atmosphere.xml,['Introduction']," Packaging protects foodstuffs from contact with the external environment and from air-borne contamination. Combined with modified atmosphere, packaging also helps to prolong the shelf life of a food product and can also contribute to improve food safety. The gaseous environment in a package can slow down or totally inhibit microbial development and can also modify the microbial ecology of the product (Chaix et al., 2015b, Gill and Ahvenainen, 2003, Mcmillin, 2008). Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) of fresh product relies on the interplay of two mechanisms: (1) modification of the atmosphere inside the package in order to reduce degradation reaction (microbial growth, oxidation, etc.) and (2) mass transfer of gases through the packaging (Floros and Matsos, 2005). The main objective of the packaging material is thus to maintain this atmosphere during food storage and therefore high barrier films are usually used by default (precautionary principle) to ensure this objective without knowing a priori, the specific needs of the product as regard O2 and / or CO2 headspace composition and its tolerance towards variations in this gas composition (Šcetar et al., 2010). As a consequence, it may be possible that, for many foods, such high barrier properties are oversized, sometimes unnecessary or even inappropriate (i.e. the material is too powerful compare to the needs of the product). Barrier films are often multi-layered and consequently expensive materials that are currently not recyclable. MAP thus represents high direct costs for the food industry. In this context there is an increasing demand for modelling tools that would permit to identify in advance the headspace gas composition and associate material suitable for ensuring microbial safety and / or anticipate microbial degradation of a given application. Such modelling tools rely on the modelling of mass transfer in the food / packaging system and their coupling with models of predictive microbiology (Chaix et al., 2015b). Such semi-mechanistic model would permit to take into account in addition to constant environmental factors such as temperature, pH, aw, acids, the impact of dynamic of O2 / CO2 exchanges in the system on the microbial growth. In spite of their interest, very few modelling tools combined mass transfer with predictive microbiology. One may cite the works of Devlieghere et al., 2001, Devlieghere et al., 1998 and that of Mejlholm and Dalgaard (2007) that took into account the impact of CO2 on bacteria growth but this concentration was considered constant. Only Simpson et al. (2003) modelled the permeation of gas through the packaging material and its impact on headspace partial pressure on bacteria growth and more recently Chaix et al. (2015a) considered in their mathematical model, in addition to permeation, the dissolution / diffusion of O2 / CO2 into the food itself and its impact on local bacterial growth. From a practical point of view, such numerical tools would decrease the number of time consuming experiments necessary for experimentally quantify and assess the evolution of a given microorganism in terms of changes in O2 and CO2 headspace partial pressures and corresponding dissolved content in the food. CO2 has an inhibitory effect and it is the most important component in the choice of a gas mixture. Its effect on several bacteria species is well known and has been evaluated, at least quantitatively by several groups of co-workers. For example, Gram-negative microorganisms such as Pseudomonas, Shewanella and Aeromonas are very sensitive to CO2 (Boskou and Debevere, 1997, Debevere et al., 2001, Molin, 1983). Gram-positive bacteria show less sensitivity and lactic acid bacteria are resistant to or even stimulated by CO2 (Arsène-Ploetze et al., 2006). Pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, C. botulinum and Listeria monocytogenes are minimally affected by CO2: the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration-for L. monocytogenes even exceeds 100% expressed in equivalent headspace partial pressure (Augustin et al., 2005), that means that more than 1 bar of CO2 pressure would be requested in the pack to inhibit Listeria growth which is not possible to achieve in practice. In predictive microbiology, secondary models have been developed to describe the effect of CO2. They were listed and discussed in Chaix et al. (2015b). We can cite for example the work of Koutsoumanis et al. (2000) that proposed a model for taking into account the combined effect of temperature and CO2 on spoilage microflora growth, the work of Alfaro et al. (2013a) that proposed a Cardinal Type Model (CM) to predict the effect of both environmental gases O2 and CO2 on the growth of a mixture of spoilage bacteria or the work of Emborg and Dalgaard (2008) that modelled effect of CO2 on Morganella psychrotolerans growth by using a CM. In all these studies, except in the work of Alfaro et al. (2013a), the concentration of CO2 was considered constant during storage. Contrary to CO2, O2 is an activating agent for aerobes growth. The role of O2 on microbial growth has been scarcely considered and modelled in predictive microbiology. Only 4 modelling attempts considered the impact of O2 on microbial growth (Alfaro et al., 2013a, Farber et al., 1996, Geysen et al., 2006, Pin et al., 2000). The impact of O2 is nevertheless indispensable to consider for modelling the growth of aerobes such as Pseudomonas. The objective of this paper was to validate in real conditions using dedicated challenge tests the mathematical model previously presented in Chaix et al. (2015a) and upgraded to take into account the effect of O2 on aerobe microbial growth and the respiration phenomenon occurring in the system. Three food products were considered: poultry, processed cheese and salmon packed in industrial packs (tray + lid film). Several internal atmospheres (mixtures of O2 / CO2 / N2), storage temperatures and gas permeability range, specific to each system, were tested to cover a large range of possibilities for (1) validating the mathematical model especially in its upper and lower limits such as high / low gas flux in the system and high / intermediate / low microbial growth and (2) representing systems of industrial relevance. Two microorganisms were selected for their contrasted metabolism (aerobe / facultative anaerobe): P. fluorescens and L. monocytogenes. In the following, a brief summary of the mathematical model used and its upgrades will be done, then simulations of challenge-tests conditions will be presented and compared to experimental data. Finally, the main features concerning the effect of gases (O2 / CO2) on P. fluorescens and L. monocytogenes growth observed in this work will be addressed followed by a discussion about the relevance of using MAP modelling tools in an holistic approach of food safety assessment.

Processed cheese was produced in this study as described elsewhere (Chaix et al., 2015c). Challenge tests were performed using a method adapted from Augustin et al. (2011) by two laboratories. Prior contamination, poultry meat was ionised 7.5 kGy using Aerial facilities to inhibit the development of naturally present microflora while salmon and cheese were kept as they were. Poultry and salmon were artificially contaminated on food surface with 0.5 ml of the diluted last subculture of L. monocytogenes or P. fluorescens in order to obtain an initial concentration of approximately 10^2 cfu / g. In the case of processed cheese, contamination was done in the mass (just after renetting and before gel formation). Microbial account was assessed on two different cheese locations, i.e. respectively in the upper and lower parts of the cheese cut in the middle, parallel to the headspace / food surface. All growth curves for cheese are thus in two parts: one for the upper part in contact with the headspace (the left one in figures shown in this paper) and one for lower part in contact with the tray (the right one). This was done like that to observe the effect of gradient of dissolved gases inside the food product on the microbial growth in the mass. For the particular case of poultry meat, both microorganisms were inoculated in the same pack on two separated pieces of meat. Control samples without inoculation with L. monocytogenes and P. fluorescens were also included. Contaminated packed foods were stored at either 4 or 8 °C and enumerations of L. monocytogenes and P. fluorescens were performed during storage according to the ISO 11290-2 standard (Anonymous, 1998a) on three samples at approximately 10 different times during the lag, the exponential and the stationary phases of the growth curve. Various Modified Atmosphere Packaging systems and packaging materials were used for each product as described in Table 1. Packaging materials tested for poultry and salmon were commercial ones, while for cheese, they were voluntarily with low barrier properties to observe effect of large permeation rate on microbial growth and to explore the limits of our model (“worse case”). Samples stored in air at 15 °C were used as control and the resulting growth curves obtained at 15 °C were further used to identify, for each strain, the optimal growth rate in optimal conditions from the cardinal values and SymPrevius software. pH and water activity (aw) were measured for each batch of studied foods. Aerobic microorganisms and mesophilic lactic acid bacteria were also enumerated at the beginning of the storage according to the ISO standards (Anonymous, 1998b and Anonymous, 2003). "

(2015a). This model takes into account the temperature effect on all physical mechanisms (solubility, diffusion, permeation) and biological phenomena (microbial growth and respiration).

Hopefully, more of these parameters could be fixed for several different systems such as activation energies because different values of Ea taken in their range of variation did not impact the prediction as revealed by a sensitivity analysis (same methodology than that used in Chaix et al.

Film permeability and activation energy for nitrogen were calculated from CO2 data with the relation established by Siracusa (2012). Solubility and diffusivity data were taken from dedicated databases (Chaix et al., 2014) and were listed in Table 5. If the food product studied in the present work was not in the database, the solubility / diffusivity values of a product of similar composition were selected.

This phenomenon has been related to an aerobic respiration mechanism that would be due to P. fluorescens. Indeed, a previous work (Chaix et al., 2015a) has underlined that respiration of L. monocytogenes (same strain than in the present work) could be neglected. Moreover, poultry meat was irradiated before inoculation, therefore interferences due to respiration of total aerobic count were avoided. Concomitantly to this O2 consumption, some CO2 production probably happened in the pack that is not obvious from Fig. 1. Indeed, evolution of headspace CO2 as a function of time is the result of an interplay of three different phenomena (1) dissolution in the food product occurring at the beginning of the kinetic as soon as the gas is injected in the pack, (2) permeation toward external atmosphere and (3) production by aerobic respiration. Preliminary simulation made using the mathematical model presented above demonstrated that by neglecting respiration equation, the CO2 level in the pack would be much more lower than that experimentally observed, confirming the CO2 production by Pseudomonas that compensated CO2 loss by dissolution and permeation. It appears that respiration phenomena (O2 consumption and CO2 production) could not be neglected in the model. Therefore, this mechanism was added in the updated version of the model by using Mickaëlis-Menten equation. Input parameters for this equation were taken in Thiele et al. (2006), the only one referenced work that attempted to model microorganism respiration (Pseudomonas). This respiration was dependent on the quantity of bacteria in the pack and thus was linked to mass balance in headspace and to microbiology predictive model. By taking into account this respiration and with the parameters of Thiele et al. (2006), a quite good prediction of gas evolution in headspace was achieved (Fig. 1). It is worth noticing than none of the parameters were adjusted in this simulation. A big uncertainty was nevertheless remaining on the initial amount of CO2 dissolved in the product. Preliminary simulations have shown that the product was not completely free of CO2 at time zero (i.e. when lid film is sealed). This initial amount of dissolved CO2 was estimated to be 1 / 3 of the maximum content that could dissolve according to the target percentage. All further simulations made for other challenge-tests confirmed this hypothesis. We note that this initial condition is of particular importance when the ratio of headspace volume to mass of food is very low as it is the case for the challenge-test “poultry”. Microbial growth curves for Pseudomonas and Listeria (Fig. 1) display completely different trends. Pseudomonas is an aerobe with a minimal concentration required for microbial growth,% O2,min, equal to 0.25% (expressed in% equivalent in headspace) and is very sensitive to CO2 with a maximal concentration,% CO2,max, equal to 40% while Listeria is not (or very little) affected by anoxia conditions nor by high level of CO2 (% CO2,max= 304% !). Indeed, several previous studies have confirmed the very low sensitivity of Listeria to CO2 which could grow, even if growth rate is slow down at very high level of CO2 content in the pack (Drosinos and Board, 1994, Farber et al., 1996, Fernández et al., 1997, Hudson et al., 1994, Pin et al., 2000). Consequently, changes in Listeria growth curves shown in Fig. 1 were mostly the result of temperature effect only (no effect of modified atmosphere) while for Pseudomonas, effect of temperature and atmosphere composition (both O2 and CO2) concomitantly intervened. At a given temperature, Pseudomonas growth is initially delayed due to CO2 content (above 40% ). Once the level of CO2 dropped below this threshold value, CO2 inhibiting effect diminished and tended to disappear permitting Pseudomonas to grow. In the same time, and as Pseudomonas account increased, respiration was more and more important leading to a rapid consumption of all the residual O2 in headspace. Once O2 dropped below the value of 0.25% , Pseudomonas growth rate became 0 and Pseudomonas growth curve is levelled off at a plateau. We note that the packaging material was quite barrier and thus, O2 ingress via permeation remained very low and could not compensate O2 consumed by respiration. It was then checked if this phenomenon occurs also for the pack stored a 15 °C in air (see Fig. a provided in Supplementary data). The experimental drop of O2 was much more slower than that predicted by the model: taking into account the quantity of microorganism in the pack, the theoretical respiration rate should be very high and O2 should be rapidly consumed which is not the case in the experimental result. The respiration rate of Pseudomonas must be slowed down to correctly model its growth in air conditions. We can conclude from this first challenge-test that respiration could be a very efficient mean to remove residual O2 inside the pack and to complete the anti-microbial effect of CO2 intentionally added in the pack. Koutsoumanis et al. (2008) also highlighted in their study that the self-developed modified atmosphere due to meat microflora in minced pork packages resulted in a significant inhibition of pseudomonad growth. However, respiration rate seems to vary depending on the experimental conditions (especially initial level of O2) which hampered the generalisation of this effect. "

1423,Validation of a predictive model coupling gas transfer and microbial growth in fresh food packed under modified atmosphere.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Analysis of model prediction for challenge-test “cheese”']"," Results of “cheese” challenge-tests are shown in Fig. 2 for Pseudomonas and Fig. 3 for Listeria. Analysis of gas exchange in the system confirmed that the packaging material is much more permeable in the present case than in the previous one (poultry challenge-test). Indeed, the CO2 content drops very rapidly from 70 to less than 10% in each pack. We observed a significant growth of the naturally present microflora (from 3 to 6-7 Log CFU / g depending on the experiment), which is consistent with the fact that processed cheese was not decontaminated before inoculation. This naturally present bacteria could severely alter the results of this challenge-test and especially act on the gas headspace concentration with possible additional respiration mechanisms. Confirming this, some results obtained on Listeria inoculated packs displayed a rapid consumption of O2 while others did not (70% CO2 / 30% N2 at 8 °C and air at 8 °C, Fig. 3). This consumption obviously did not come from Listeria because that strain was proved to not consume O2 but more probably from the naturally present microflora. This uncertainty on respiration limits the model accuracy to predict the evolution of gas evolution in headspace (Fig. 2) and consequently Pseudomonas growth, which is highly dependent on the level of O2 and CO2 in the pack. It is therefore very important to accurately model the dynamic of gas exchange in MAP for an accurate prediction of aerobes such as Pseudomonas. As previously observed for “poultry” tests, Listeria growth on cheese was not affected by the tested modified atmospheres. Only temperature effect was noticed. In spite of a significant lower optimal growth rate for Pseudomonas (0.55 for cheese instead of 2.88 h^-1 for poultry), growth was much more important in the case of “cheese” than “poultry”. This is due to the rapid loss of CO2 inside the pack by permeation (high permeable material) leading to almost no anti-microbial effect of the selected atmosphere in spite of the high level of CO2 injected. Anoxia occurred too late in the pack to significantly inhibit Pseudomonas growth. We did not observe any significant differences between “upper” and “lower” growth curves. This is due to the fact that gradients of O2 and CO2 were not significant in the cheese because of its low thickness. Diffusion was not rate limiting in this system. "

In spite of a slight underestimate growth at 4 °C, the model succeeded in predicting gas evolution in headspace and microbial growth whatever the temperature studied. Once again this result is satisfying because no adjustment of the model to the data was carried out. Discrepancies were thus quasi unavoidable when considering the biological variability of the food system. "

1428,Validation of a predictive model coupling gas transfer and microbial growth in fresh food packed under modified atmosphere.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Discussion and interest of the model as Decision Support Tool']"," Despite of the complexity of the simulated phenomenon, and the high number of input parameters, the model presented here was quite well validated using the results of the challenge-tests. Some slight deviations occurred in some cases between experimental and predicted data due to, as explained above, remaining uncertainty on some mechanisms (such as respiration) and the unavoidable biological variability of the system. It is worth noticing that the model is complex, coupling different mechanisms and it was very challenging to use input parameters determined on independent experiments to predict results obtained in challenge tests. Indeed, most input parameters were considered as constant, biological variability was not computed and none identification of parameters was carried out. That is why the model cannot always fit perfectly the experimental results. Once validated the aforementioned model could be used as a Decision Support Tool to help the user to properly design its system (internal atmosphere composition, ratio food volume to headspace volume, etc.) and to rationally select its packaging material. Such approach starts from the needs of the product (i.e. maximal level of bacteria permitted at the use-by-date) to go toward an identification of the suitable modified atmosphere packaging system for the product. Demonstration of such approach is proposed in the following. Supposing that poultry meat must be stored during at least 15 d. The maximal load tolerated at the use-by-date is 10^7 CFU g^-1 (hypothetical value) for an initial load of 10^3 CFU g^-1 (hypothetical value). The target storage temperature is 4 °C. In practice, it is commonly accepted that the product stays 1 / 3 of its shelf life at 4 °C and 2 / 3 at 8 °C. Preliminary simulations have revealed that the optimal atmosphere for this product is around 50% of CO2 and less than 2% of residual O2. The next step is to identify which packaging material would be suitable for the product in a rational and sustainable way, i.e. which would be the “just necessary” packaging material without oversizing of its barrier properties. Indeed, most often, high barrier material, i.e. costly multilayers that are not recyclable, are chosen by default to be sure that the initial atmosphere injected in the pack will be maintained all long the storage. These over-dimensioned barrier properties are usually not required for the product. The modelling tool proposed here permits to test different set of O2 and CO2 permeabilities and to identify a range of suitable values for this application. It is obvious from Fig. 5 that, due to O2 consumption into the pack that induces anoxia and thus a detrimental atmosphere for Pseudomonas, the values of 1.0 × 10^-16 mol m^-1 s^-1 Pa^-1 for O2 permeability and 4 × 10^-16 mol m^-1 s^-1 Pa^-1 for CO2 permeability are low enough to ensure a shelf life of more than 15d for the product with a criteria of a maximal load at use-by-date of 10^7 CFU g^-1. It is thus not necessary to choose a more barrier material as the one tested in third solution. The second step is to find the packaging material displaying such values of permeabilities. This could be done by query packaging database that gather O2 and CO2 permeabilities. Last step is to test this material for a final validation of the selection made. This requirement driven approach is very efficient for helping food manufacturers in rapidly identifying materials for their MAP application, saving cost and time. "

1430,Validation of a predictive model coupling gas transfer and microbial growth in fresh food packed under modified atmosphere.xml,['Conclusions']," In this paper we validated a semi-mechanistic model aiming at predicting the effect of dynamic of gas exchanges in the food / packaging on microbial growth. The model succeeded quite well in predicting the evolution of gas concentrations in headspace and growth of Listeria and Pseudomonas in various conditions of storage (temperature and atmosphere) and for the three kinds of food studied, packed in industrial-like conditions. Respiration of microorganisms (probably aerobes) occurred in the different experimental packs and must be taken into account in the model. This phenomenon was not really well studied and modelled for microorganisms and induced the largest part of inaccuracy of the model predictions. It appears that respiration could contribute to limit growth of aerobes by consuming residual O2. This effect cumulates with the anti-bacterial effect of CO2. This is particularly relevant for microorganisms especially sensitive to moderate CO2 content and to anoxia such as Pseudomonas. Once validated, the model could be used as a Decision Support Tool to design the MAP system and to help the food manufacturer to choose the “just necessary” packaging material in a more rational and sustainable way than by using a “trial and error” approach.

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were obtained from sugarcane bagasse. Starch and starch / CNC films were formulated and their water barrier properties were studied. The measured film solubility, contact angle, and water sorption isotherm indicated that reinforced starch / CNC films have a lower affinity to water molecules than starch films. The effects that the driving force and the water activity (aw) values at each side of the film have on permeability were analyzed. Permeability, diffusivity, and solubility coefficients indicated that the permeation process depends mostly on the tortuous pathway formed by the incorporation of CNC and therefore were mainly controlled by water diffusion.

1438,Water barrier properties of starch films reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals obtained from sugarcane bagasse.xml,['Introduction']," Polysaccharides such as starch, cellulose derivates and plant gums have been studied as edible films and coatings in food packaging and preservation (Kester & Fennema, 1986). Generally, the main functional properties of these hydrophilic materials depend strongly on their water content and therefore on the surrounding humidity. The relationship between water activity (aw) and the moisture content of a material is explained by means of its moisture sorption isotherms. Water permeability depends on its solubility and diffusivity, the former is obtained from water sorption isotherms while the latter is related to the diffusion path of water molecules in the film matrix. In addition, water also acts as a plasticizer for hydrophilic materials and a swelling process occurs affecting the barrier properties, which depend strongly on water content (Bertuzzi, Armada, & Gottifredi, 2003). Nanotechnology focuses on the characterization, fabrication and manipulation of biological and nonbiological structures smaller than 100 nm. The design of internal micro or nanoscale structures can improve the functional properties, morphology and stability of the polymer matrix used in edible films and coatings (Azeredo, 2009). Cellulose is the most abundant renewable polymer in the world; it is found in plant cell walls, and it can also be synthesized by some bacteria. Its reinforcing property is remarkable (Tashiro & Kobayashi, 1991). Basically two types of nanoreinforcements can be obtained from cellulose: microfibrils and whiskers. In the case of plants or animals, the cellulose chains are synthesized to form microfibrils (or nanofibres), which are bundles of molecules that are elongated and stabilized through hydrogen bonding (Wang & Sain, 2007). The microfibrils have nanosized diameters (2-20 nm, depending on the origin), and their lengths are in the micrometre range (Azizi Samir et al., 2004, Oksman et al., 2006). Each microfibril is formed by aggregation of elementary fibrils, which are made up of crystalline and amorphous parts. The crystalline parts, which can be isolated by several treatments, are the whiskers, also known as nanocrystals (CNC), nanorods, or rodlike cellulose microcrystals (Azizi Samir et al., 2004, Dujardin et al., 2003), with lengths ranging from 500 nm up to 1-2 μm, and about 8-20 nm or less in diameter (Azizi Samir et al., 2004, Lima and Borsali, 2004), resulting in high aspect ratios. Each microfibril can be considered as a string of whiskers connected by amorphous domains (which act as structural defects), and having a modulus close to that of a crystal of native cellulose (about 150 GPa) and a strength of about 10 GPa (Helbert, Cavaillé, & Dufresne, 1996). These values are only about seven times lower than those of single walled carbon nanotubes (Podsiadlo et al., 2005). Bagasse is the by-product obtained after sucrose extraction from the sugar cane plant. It has a high proportion of cellulose, which can be readily isolated from the other components namely lignin and hemicelluloses. The cellulose is obtained from bagasse by a pulping process (Zanin et al., 2000). Bondeson and Oksman (2007), Paralikar, Simonsen, and Lombardi (2008), Svagan, Hedenqvist, and Berglund (2009) and Belbekhouche et al. (2011) obtained nanocomposites based on different polymer matrices reinforced with cellulose fibres or whiskers. Kvien, Sugiyama, Votrubec, and Oksman (2007) and Savadekar and Mhaske (2012) studied the effect of CNC incorporation on thermoplastic starch matrix and found that the incorporation of nanofillers improved their barrier and mechanical properties. The description and prediction of water vapour transport through hydrophilic films are extremely complex. The complexity is due to the nonlinear behaviour of water sorption isotherms and the water content dependency on diffusivity at high water activities. Water vapour transmission rate of hydrophilic films varies nonlinearly with water vapour pressure (Wiles, Vergano, Barron, Bunn, & Testin, 2000) at water activities higher than 0.55. At lower water activities, Wiles et al. (2000) and Debeaufort, Voilley, and Meares (1994) reported a linear dependence of water vapour transmission rate with water vapour pressure. Larotonda, Matsui, Sobral, and Laurindo (2005) and Müller, Yamashita, and Borges Laurindo (2008) investigated the influence of the diffusion coefficient (Deff), the water vapour permeability (P) and the solubility coefficient of water (β) in different polymers. The β value, called film hydrophilicity, can be calculated from the first derivative of the water sorption isotherm (represented by GAB model fit) in relation to aw, divided by the water vapour pressure (pw) at the sorption isotherm temperature. The average β values for each range were determined and represented by β'. Water vapour permeability can be obtained using the ASTM E96 method (Bertuzzi, Castro Vidaurre, Armada, & Gottifredi, 2007). The diffusivity coefficient can be obtained from solubility and permeability coefficients (Larotonda et al., 2005). The aim of this work was to determine the effect of variations of assay parameters such as water vapour gradient (permeation process driving force) and water vapour pressure values at each side of the film on water vapour permeability of starch / CNC nanocomposite films.

The salts used (LiBr, LiCl, CH3COOK, MgCl2, K2CO3, Mg(NO3)2, NaBr, NaCl, KCl) were the different salts recommended by the European project COST-90 (Spiess & Wolf, 1983), to cover a water activity (aw) range from 0.05 to 0.90. Film samples (rectangular strips of approximately 2 cm^2 area) were first freeze-dried (Thermovac Industries Corp., USA) and stored in a desiccator with P2O5 during 48 h. Samples were weighed and each one was placed on a plastic lattice by holding it on a tripod inside the sorbostats that contain the different saturated salt solutions. Then the sorbostats were sealed. The sorbostats were kept inside an environmental chamber maintained at constant temperature (25 °C). Film samples were equilibrated in the sorbostats for 4 days before their weights were recorded. The weights of the samples were checked during 3 more days. Equilibrium was judged to have been attained when the difference between two consecutive sample weightings was less than 1 mg / g dry solid. Data were reported for each relative humidity as gram of water sorbed / 100 g dry film. The moisture sorption measurements were performed in quadruplicate at each aw. The data obtained were fitted by GAB sorption model, as described by Eq. (5):(5)we=w0⋅C⋅k⋅aw(1-k⋅aw)(1-k⋅aw+C⋅k⋅aw)where we is the equilibrium moisture content (g water / 100 g dry film), w0 is the monolayer content (g water / 100 g dry film), C is Guggenhein constant related to sorption heat monolayer, k is a correction factor related to sorption heat multilayer.

The percentage error (% Error) has been widely adopted throughout the literature to evaluate the goodness of fit of sorption models. A% Error value below 10% is indicative of a good fit for practical applications (Al-Muhtaseb, McMinn, & Magee, 2002). "

Film specimens were conditioned for 48 h in a chamber at 25 °C and 53% relative humidity (Mg(NO3)2 saturated salt solution) before being analyzed. Films were sealed on cups containing different saturated salt solutions or distilled water that provides higher relative humidity. Test cups were placed in a desiccator cabinet maintained at constant temperature. Saturated salt solutions were used to provide specific relative humidity. In all cases, relative humidity inside the desiccator cabin was lower than relative humidity inside the cups. Table 4 shows the range of aw used in each assay. A fan was used to maintain uniform conditions at all test locations over the specimen. Weight loss measurements were taken by continuous weighing of the test cup to the nearest 0.001 g with an electronic scale (Ohaus PA313, USA). Data were transferred to a computer. Weight loss was plotted over time and when steady state (straight line) was reached, 8 h more were registered. Thickness value was the mean value of five measurements and it was used for water vapour permeability calculations. The water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) was calculated from the slope (G) of a linear regression of weight loss versus time (Eq.

1452,Water barrier properties of starch films reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals obtained from sugarcane bagasse.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Characterization of CNC']"," The chemical composition of the sugarcane bagasse after each stage of the chemical treatment is shown in Table 1. It was found that, at the end of the alkaline treatment, the cellulose content increases while the hemicelluloses and lignin contents decrease significantly. This is due to the alkaline treatment of lignocellulosic fibres, the fibres surface area increases and causes the polysaccharides to become more susceptible to hydrolysis. Zuluaga et al. (2009) reported that by using NaClO2, a greater removal of lignin was obtained. After the bleaching process, an increase in cellulose content and a decrease in lignin content were observed. Fig. 1 shows micrographs obtained by SEM and TEM of CF, and CNC. After the extraction process, the fibres presented similar morphological structure to CF obtained by Zimmermann, Bordeanu, and Strub (2010). CF exhibited an irregular size with a diameter of approximately 10 μm. SEM of CNC (Fig. 1b) shows a crystal-like structure after the acid hydrolysis process. Average length (L) and diameter (D) of CNC and L / D values that were obtained from TEM images are 247.51 (±32.34), 10.11 (±3.36) and 24.48 nm, respectively (Fig. 1c). The L and D values present a typical Gaussian distribution. X-ray diffractograms were performed on CF and CNC powder (Fig. 2). The diffractograms display a mixture of polymorphs of cellulose I (typical peaks at 2θ∼15 ° and 22 °) and cellulose II (Klemm, Heublein, Fink, & Bohn, 2005). In order to determine the crystalline degree of the samples, the ratio of the crystalline area to the total area can be calculated. However, to determine the crystalline area, the amorphous part must be known. This can be obtained by X-ray diffraction of a completely amorphous cellulose sample (Bondeson et al., 2006). Nevertheless, by comparing the intensities of the diffraction peaks of both samples, it is possible to determine a change in crystallinity. The intensity of the peaks in the diffractogram of CNC was significantly higher than the peak intensities in the diffractogram of FC. Thus, the crystallinity increased as a result of the acid hydrolysis treatment. Results indicate that the amorphous regions were removed by the acid hydrolysis. Chen, Liu, Chang, Cao, and Anderson (2009) obtain similar results in pea hull fibres. "

1458,Water barrier properties of starch films reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals obtained from sugarcane bagasse.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Film solubility in water']"," Solubility in water is an important property of films for food packaging applications. Some potential uses may require water insolubility to enhance product integrity and water resistance. However, in other cases, water solubility of the film before product consumption might be useful as in encapsulation of food or additives. The addition of CNC reduces the film solubility from 26.6% to 18.5% (Table 2). It is indicative of strong interactions between starch chains and CNC in the film matrix. CNC are capable of interacting with starch chains through hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of CNC. These interactions provide stability and resistance to starch / CNC films. Rhim and Ng (2007) reported that the reduction observed in solubility of films reinforced with different nanofillers is mainly related to the strong hydrogen bond formation between hydroxyl groups of the biopolymer and the nanoparticles. These results were corroborated by Abdollahi, Alboofetileh, Rezaei, and Behrooz (2013) in alginate / CNC films. Besides Tunc et al. (2007) informed that these interactions improve the cohesiveness of the biopolymer matrix and decrease the water sensitivity because water molecules are not able to break these strong bonds. Cao, Chen, Chang, Stumborg, and Huneault (2008) indicated that the matrix structure and the resulting competition between matrix / filler and filler / filler interactions are among the most important factors that determine the reinforcing effect of nanofillers.

An increase in the contact angle indicates an increase in film hydrophobicity. Table 2 shows that the contact angle and the surface energy were altered by CNC incorporation. These results, as well as the solubility values, indicate a strong interaction between starch chains and CNC. The formation of hydrogen bonds between them reduces the interaction between water and the film surface. According to Cao et al. (2008) the observed improvement in the hydrophobic character of films with CNC addition is mainly related to the highly hydrophobic properties of the nanocellulose crystals. Abdollahi et al. (2013) observed a high increment of the hydrophobic character in alginate films when they were added with CNC. "

Table 2 shows the effect of CNC incorporation into starch films. An important increase in T and Y and a decrease in% ɛ were observed. The high T and Y values indicated that the filler was properly dispersed in the matrix structure. Similarities in the chemical structure of cellulose and starch promote strong interactions between them. The elongation at break decreases due to the rigid nature of the filler and it is in agreement with previous results published in the literature (Müller et al., 2009, Pereda et al., 2011). "
1462,Water barrier properties of starch films reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals obtained from sugarcane bagasse.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Density']", Film density values show not significant differences between starch and starch / CNC films (Table 2). This could be due to the similarity between densities of both materials and the low proportion of the filler into the film matrix. Azizi Samir et al.

1463,Water barrier properties of starch films reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals obtained from sugarcane bagasse.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Moisture sorption isotherm']"," Fig. 4 shows moisture sorption isotherm data obtained at 25 °C for starch and starch / CNC films. Sorption curves were typical of water sensitive polymers and sorption levels were within the range reported for starch film (Kampeerapappun et al., 2007, Müller et al., 2011). Experimental data present similar values at low aw range for starch and starch / CNC films and take an exponential course at high relative humidities (above 0.60). Under these conditions, hydrophilic polymeric chains swell altering its structure. Experimental data obtained for starch / CNC film indicate that incorporation of CNC reduces water sorption, demonstrating that water has less affinity for the film. Sorption data corroborate the behaviour observed in solubility tests and contact angle measurements. CNC present stronger interaction with starch than with water. The number of active sites for water binding decreases due to the formation of strong bonds between starch and CNC, reducing the moisture content of starch / CNC films as water activity increases. This effect is more evident in the medium water activity range. Pereda et al. (2011) indicated that due to the strong interaction between starch and CNC, the plasticizer plays a determining role in the sorption process. The material plasticization generates a greater opening to new water adsorption sites, yielding higher moisture content in the film. Glycerol incorporated into the film formulation produces the plasticization of the polymeric structure which leads to an exponential increase in the moisture content of the film. Kristo and Biliaderis (2007) and George (2012) obtained similar sorption isotherms of starch films with the addition of starch nanocrystals and gelatine film with the addition of CNC, respectively. Table 3 shows the GAB model parameters obtained for starch films and starch / CNC films. The water monolayer value decreases with incorporation of CNC into polymeric matrix. This indicates that CNC reduce the site number where water molecules can interact with starch chains, decreasing the adsorption of water in the film. Bilbao-Sainz, Bras, Williams, Sénechal, and Orts (2011) obtained a decrease in monolayer values of HPMC films with increasing CNC content. A similar behaviour was observed for high amylose starch based films, indicating that water acts as a strong solvent or swelling agent for the polymer (Bertuzzi et al., 2003). "

1466,Water barrier properties of starch films reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals obtained from sugarcane bagasse.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Water vapour permeability, solubility and diffusivity']"," Fig. 5 shows the water solubility coefficients as a function of water activity for starch films and starch / CNC films. At low values of aw, solubility remains practically constant, but there is an exponential increase from aw = 0.6, for both kind of films. This inflexion point corresponds to the completion of the monolayer as can be seen in Table 3. Beyond aw = 0.6, water molecules recover mobility and the water solubility in the film increases notoriously. In the range of aw = 0.55-0.85, the differences between solubility of starch films and starch / CNC films are the greatest, showing the effect of CNC incorporation in the starch matrix. CNC act delaying the plasticizing effect of water on film due to the high interaction between OH-groups of starch and CNC. At high values of aw, the solubility values of both films merge. Table 4 shows corrected and uncorrected water vapour permeability for the different ranges of aw used to generate the water vapour gradient through the film. The% Error was calculated according to the procedure delineated by Gennadios et al. (1994). The results indicate that, at the same value of Δaw, the% Error in the permeability measurements presented by starch films increases with aw at each side of the film. However, in the case of starch / CNC films,% Error remains practically constant. This is due to the difference between WVTR of both films and indicates the importance of data correction to obtain a better understanding of barrier properties of these films. According to Gennadios et al. (1994) the higher the WVTR through a film the more important is air gap resistance and the larger the error produced from overlooking this effect. The% Error observed for starch / CNC films are lower than that obtained for starch films due to the low WVTR of the nanocomposites films. Permeability increases with aw at each side of the film when similar driving force (Δaw) was used in starch film. However, in contrast to results reported by Slavutsky and Bertuzzi (2012) about starch / MMT films, water permeability of starch / CNC film was not dependent on aw. This would indicate that the permeation process is controlled by the diffusion of water through the film and not by the solubility of water in the matrix. According to Kristo and Biliaderis (2007), the addition of rigid crystalline structures produces a tortuous path that hinders the passage of water molecules through the film matrix. The driving force and the aw at each side of the film play important roles in the permeability process. At high aw, adsorption of water molecules produces a great increment on mobility of starch chain in the starch film, but it is less important in starch / CNC films. Diffusion coefficient data provide more information and evidence of CNC effect in the water barrier behaviour of the starch matrix. In general, at low values of aw, when moisture content increases, the films swell and increase their plasticization, therefore diffusivity increases significantly (Slavutsky & Bertuzzi, 2012). Nevertheless, when aw are higher than 0.5, diffusivity decreases. In this work, the phenomenological analysis was performed at high water content. Table 4 shows solubility and diffusivity coefficients obtained by application of Eqs. (11), (12), respectively. Obtained values indicate that incorporation of CNC reduces the Deff of starch film. At a similar driving force (Δaw = 0.2), Deff decreases with the increment of aw values at each side of the film. It can be explained by the fact that water molecules plasticize the film, generate the polymer matrix relaxation, and promote the adsorption of water molecules in new active sites. Water molecule clustering occurs, resulting in a decrease of diffusivity. When the driving force is 0.2 and aw at each side of the film are lower than 0.5, there is a little difference between solubility of starch films and starch / CNC films. In this range, the permeation process is controlled by the diffusion process. SEM images indicated that CNC are homogenously dispersed into the starch matrix. Several authors have reported that CNC incorporation produces a tortuous pathway that decreases Deff (Azizi Samir et al., 2004, Cao et al., 2008, George, 2012). A combined effect of solubility and diffusivity on permeability is found at aw middle values. It is originated by the tortuous pathway and the lower adsorption of water molecules in the starch / CNC matrix. In this zone, the plasticizing effect of water is more important on the starch matrix. The homogeneous dispersion of CNC into starch matrix provides an effective tortuous pathway, producing a less favourable diffusion of water molecules, making the water permeability more dependent on Deff. Fig. 5 shows Deff vs. aw when the driving force is equal 0.2. The variation of diffusivity and solubility coefficients with aw, and the differences between both films tested can be observed. According to Debeaufort, Voilley, and Meares (1994), this kind of behaviour may be explained by the water cluster formation. Once a monolayer of water molecules moistens the film, a further increase in moisture results in “free water” that does not interact with the polymer. The free water molecules aggregate to form di-, tri-, and tetramer clusters. The molecular volume of these clusters is larger than that of monomers and results in decreased diffusion. The incorporation of CNC maintains the effect on water diffusivity at high aw values due to the generation of a tortuous pathway that provides an extra decrease of Deff. In addition, Wan et al. (2009) indicated that the resulting interaction between starch and glycerol may promote adsorption of moisture, due to dimensional changes in the area where the adhesion between interfaces (starch-glycerol) is poor, thus creating a step that facilitates the accumulation of water molecules. However, due to the chemical similarity between starch and CNC, structural and interface defects decrease, creating a strong resistance to the passage of water molecules. It could be conclude that due to the increase in the plasticization process that occurs in the polymer structure, permeation process depends mainly on the diffusion coefficient and on the formation of a tortuous path by CNC, which at high moisture contents still produces a barrier effect on water molecule movement. This arises from the results observed in Δaw = 0.762-1.00 range, where the decrease in Deff due to the CNC incorporation was of approximately 74% , whereas in the rest of the ranges studied, the decrease was about 35% .

The incorporation of CNC into the starch films matrix improved their water resistance and water barrier properties. The similar chemical structures of the polymer matrix and the CNC led to strong adhesion between them through hydrogen bonding. Contac angle measurements and water sorption isotherms indicated that reinforced films have less affinity by water molecules. Permeability, diffusivity and solubility coefficients indicated that the permeation process was controlled by the water diffusion and was depend on the tortuous pathway formed by CNC incorporation. The decrease in surface hydrophilicity and the improvement in water vapour barrier properties with the addition of CNC showed that these nanocomposites present excellent potential as a new biomaterial for application in food packaging and conservation.

1477,Water vapor and oxygen-barrier performance of corn–zein coated polypropylene films.xml,['Introduction']," The purpose of food packaging is to preserve the quality of the food from its manufacture to consumer use. The most common quality losses are associated with water vapor and oxygen transfer. They can be blocked only by using barrier coatings on packaging materials (US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1993). The conventional barrier coatings typically consist of expensive and synthetic polymers such as ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) and polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC). Although these are excellent synthetic coatings, their disadvantage is related to difficulty entailed in their recycling due to not easy separation of coating from coated surface. It is well known that only the recycling of single component thermoplastic films is generally feasible, and the coated films containing layers of different synthetic polymers may not be recycled. Furthermore, the growing reliance on these synthetic coated packaging films has risen on number of environmental concerns (US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1993; Tharanathan, 2003). The increased consumption of these laminated packaging films has resulted in increased environmental waste. Therefore, food industry is considering alternative packaging materials for coatings in terms of recyclability, reutilization, easy separation from surface, and ecological friendliness. Today, there is an increasing interest in the development of biodegradable polymers as barrier coatings for packaging industry (Chandra and Rustgi, 1998, Cutter, 2006, Reddy et al., 2003). The most important advantage of this type of coatings is an easy separation from the surface by chemical or enzymatic processes, and this provides a higher possibility for recycling. These biodegradable coating materials include polysaccharides (i.e. starch, cellulose, chitosan / chitin), proteins (whey protein, corn-zein, wheat gluten, soy protein), or lipids (animal, plant-derived, etc.) (Chandra and Rustgi, 1998). Many research studies of biodegradable coating based on polysaccharides, whey proteins and lipids have been well reviewed (Cuq et al., 1998, Hong and Krochta, 2004, Hong and Krochta, 2006, Hong et al., 2005, Miller and Krochta, 1997; Debeaufort et al., 1998). The barrier properties especially to water vapor of polysaccharide-based coatings are lower compared to protein-based coatings due to specific structures of proteins which confer a wider range of potential functional properties, especially high intermolecular binding potential. High molecular weight proteins are generally insoluble in water and are thus suitable to form water vapor resistant coatings (Cuq et al., 1998). Particularly among proteins, the extremely good barrier properties of corn-zein proteins make them potentially useful as a barrier coating material for food packaging (Lai and Padua, 1997, Lawton, 2004). Zein is the alcohol-soluble protein found in corn endosperm, and it is the byproduct of the corn wet milling industry. Zein is a relatively hydrophobic and thermoplastic material; this hydrophobicity is related to its high content of non-polar amino acids (Shukla and Cheryan, 2001). The packaging films made from an alcohol-soluble protein like ∗∗corn-zein, have relatively high barrier properties compared to other proteins. However, studies are limited with only usage of corn-zein as stand-alone films (Lai and Padua, 1997, Lawton, 2004, Shukla and Cheryan, 2001, Bertuzzi et al., 2007, Wang and Padua, 2006). Corn-zein may also be taken part in coating of conventional packaging plastics. Polypropylene (PP) has been widely used in diverse packaging applications due to abundant supply, low cost and processability. PP is usually coated with previously mentioned synthetic polymers including EVOH, or PVDC to obtain higher barrier properties in which the resulting films are quite expensive and non-recyclable. Therefore, replacing these synthetic barrier layers with corn-zein protein coatings provide a new path for use of corn-zein and improve recyclability of PP. This study is aimed to develop a novel film structure of plasticized corn-zein coatings on PP films for food packaging applications, and to examine in detail water vapor permeability properties of the resulting coated film as affected by coating formulation (solvent, corn-zein and plasticizer concentrations and also plasticizer type).

Oxygen permeabilities of coated films were determined at constant temperature (23 °C) and relative humidity (0% RH) conditions. The coated film was placed between two sides of test chamber. One side was exposed to carrier gas containing 98% N2 and 2% H2 while the other side was exposed to test gas of 5% O2 and 95% N2. The sensor monitoring the exit port of the carrier gas side measured the amount of oxygen present. The measurement was completed when the concentration of oxygen in the exit of carrier gas was constant and then OP was calculated by dividing exit concentration with transfer film area and time required to reach for stationary state. Furthermore, since overall permeability of multilayer structure is calculated, permeability of each layer could also be calculated by using the following equation known as two layer-model;(2)LP=∑i=1nLiPiwhere n is the number of layers, L and P are the thickness and permeability of the multilayer film, Li and Pi is the thickness and permeability of each layer.

1485,Water vapor and oxygen-barrier performance of corn–zein coated polypropylene films.xml,['Results and discussions']," It is well known that water vapor and oxygen-barrier properties of packaging materials are important factors determining the shelf-life of food products. Transport properties of coated packaging materials are often influenced by coating composition. Since barrier properties of packaging material are responsible for product quality deterioration and shelf-life reduction, the detailed understanding of the characteristics of coated films is great practical and commercial importance. Therefore, design and optimization of the coating composition become more important for food packaging materials. In this study, the plasticized corn-zein coatings with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and glycerol (GLY) on PP films were prepared to evaluate the water vapor and oxygen permeability properties of coated films as affected by solvent, corn-zein, and plasticizer concentration, and also by plasticizer type. Statistical analysis of data obtained from full factorial design was performed to examine the relationship among these different factors. Factors were examined at two levels, typically one of the upper and the other one is lower limit. Central points were also included in the design. Testing of all four factors (ethanol, corn-zein, and plasticizer concentration, and also plasticizer type) simultaneously would involve factorial design with eleven experiments determined by statistical analysis system, MODDE version 7.0.

They work as spacers between protein chains decreasing intermolecular forces and thus increase the flexibility and the extensibility of corn-zein films. Statistical analysis revealed that addition of plasticizers increased permeability of corn-zein coated PP films to water vapor presumably due to an increase in free volume between protein chains. Plasticizers may have increased the polymer free volume that allowed the segments of polymeric chains to increase their mobility, and the increase in the effective diffusion coefficient of water vapor in the films was also resulted by this increment of the mobility of protein chains. It was observed that the transfer rate of water vapor is closely related to the mobility of the polymer chains and especially free volume of chain segments (Duda et al., 1982, Kumar and Gupta, 1998). The higher segment mobility resulted in higher water vapor permeability of coated PP films. The higher WVP of corn-zein coated PP films plasticized by PEG as compared to GLY plasticized films may be related to the hydration of the plasticizers since water is more closely associated with PEG compared to GLY. It is known that the PEG system is more effective in attracting water molecules to the film surface. Furthermore, formation of less dense structure in corn-zein coating solution by PEG initiated water vapor permeability and more hydrophilic nature of PEG compared to GLY may also cause an increase in WVP. In general, it can be concluded that high ratio of plasticizer to corn-zein amount resulted in a rise in WVP of coated PP films while films with zein coating having low plasticizer content have high barrier to water vapor. Several authors studied the influence of the plasticizer content on barrier properties of zein films, and they showed that there is an increase in WVP of films with an increase in plasticizer content (Lai and Padua, 1997, Parris and Coffin, 1997, Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2006b, Rakotonirainy and Padua, 2001). The results of these studies agree with those reported in this study. Parris and Coffin (1997) studied the effect of various plasticizers on the WVP of the free-standing zein films. Water vapor barrier properties were the best for unplasticized zein films, and incorporation of plasticizers, PEG and GLY, into the zein films resulted in an almost doubling of WVP values. The increase in WVP was more pronounced for films plasticized with PEG which is similar with our findings (Parris and Coffin, 1997). Lawton (2004) studied the relationship between plasticizer type and water sorption of zein films and it was reported that the amount of absorbed water by films depend on the plasticizers used in the film in the order of GLY > PEG. It was also found that plasticizing efficiency increased with the increasing molecular weight of the plasticizer. Thus, PEG plasticized films had higher plasticizing efficiency than GLY plasticized films. Therefore, these results in literature confirm our permeability results of the films plasticized with PEG having higher values than GLY plasticized films. "
1489,Water vapor and oxygen-barrier performance of corn–zein coated polypropylene films.xml,"['Results and discussions', 'Water vapor permeability of coated films', 'The effect of solvent and corn–zein concentration']"," Since corn-zein has hydrophobic character due to its high content of non-polar amino acids, corn-zein films were expected to have variable behavior against water vapor depending on its concentration in the film. In addition, ethanol concentration affects the solubility of corn-zein and this resulted in different permeability properties of coated films. Since the amount of corn-zein present in the coating formulations affects the hydrophobicity of coated PP films, the WVP of films was influenced by corn-zein concentration. The films coated with solutions containing higher amount of zein created the more hydrophobic nature than the coated PP films containing low corn-zein in the coating solutions, thus the improvement in the water barrier properties was observed for high concentrations of zein. According to statistical analysis (Table 2), solvent (ethanol) and corn concentration have significant effect on WVP of PEG and GLY plasticized films. When PEG was used as the plasticizer, increase in solvent and corn concentration resulted in a rise of WVP. However, in case of GLY plasticized films, increased solvent and corn concentration have a decreasing effect on WVP. For GLY as the plasticizer, solvent and corn interaction was also a significant factor at p < 0.05. "
1490,Water vapor and oxygen-barrier performance of corn–zein coated polypropylene films.xml,"['Results and discussions', 'Oxygen-barrier properties of coated films']"," The good oxygen-barrier properties of corn-zein coated PP films are critical for achieving a long shelf-life for the packaged food products as water barrier properties. The oxygen transmission rates (OTR) of some of the corn-zein coated PP films measured at 23 °C and 0% RH were given in Table 3 as a function of plasticizer type and its concentration. The OTR values of PP films was significantly decreased upon with corn-zein coating. The application of plasticized corn-zein coating on PP films showed nearly more than two or three order of reduction in OTR of PP films when compared to without coating (in where OTR of PP film was determined as 2000 cc / m^2 × day). It is found that oxygen transmission value increased with the plasticizer content. The increase in O2 permeability with plasticizer content is associated with the hydrophilic nature of plasticizers used. The further break down of hydrogen bonds created additional sites for the dissolution of oxygen and increased the mobility of the O2 molecules within the coating layer. The higher mobility of the corn-zein chains resulted in easy O2 diffusion through the film. High humidity may also cause swelling of the film and allows faster diffusion of the gases. Furthermore, type of plasticizer used also influenced OTR of the corn-zein coating on PP films. Corn-zein coatings plasticized with PEG on PP films had higher OTR values compared to GLY plasticized films. The increase in corn-zein concentration of coating solution from 5% to 15% (w / v) resulted in higher O2-barrier property of coated PP films. The OTR of PP coated films with solution containing 15% (w / v) corn-zein plasticized with 20% PEG was measured to investigate the effect of corn-zein concentration on OTR. The OTR of this coated PP film was determined as 466 cc / m^2 × day which was lower than PP film coated with solution containing 5% (w / v) corn-zein plasticized with 20% PEG shown in Table 3 as 811 cc / m^2 × day. This improvement was caused by the excellent oxygen-barrier properties of free-standing zein films, thus higher amount of zein present in coating formulation resulted in lower O2 permeability of coated PP film. The high oxygen-barrier property of free-standing zein films is well known from several reviews published in literature (Cuq et al., 1998, Rakotonirainy and Padua, 2001, Hsu et al., 2005). It was reported that oxygen permeability values of zein films are lower than those of common synthetic plastic films such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), PP, polystyrene (PS), and poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC). Furthermore, Shin and coworkers (2002) obtained excellent oxygen-barrier of corn-zein coated LDPE films in agreement with our results. They showed that LDPE films coated with zein reduced oxygen permeability compared to uncoated LDPE. Bilayer films including corn-zein coating showed nearly 10 times lower oxygen permeability (Shin et al., 2002). For using two layer-model, the O2 permeability (OP) of corn-zein coating can be calculated from Eq. (2). The estimated OP values of corn-zein coating plasticized using PEG and GLY according to experimental design were listed in Table 4. In Table 5, the comparison of OP values corn-zein coating determined in this study were compared with the common coating materials used in the industry. From the results, it can be said that the corn-zein coatings show potential to use as an oxygen-barrier packaging material. "

The degree of hydrophobicity of surface is important for barrier and printable properties of coated films. The contact angle formed between the water droplets placed on the surface of the coated film and the kinetics of spreading is related to the hydrophobicity of the film. It is well known that the water contact angle increases with increasing surface hydrophobicity. The surface hydrophobicity of zein coated films depends on the coating formulation including corn-zein concentration, plasticizer concentration, and plasticizer type. Effects of these parameters examined on the surface hydrophobicity were given in Table 6. According to statistical analysis, solvent, corn and plasticizer concentrations are all important parameters for both PEG and GLY plasticized proteins (Table 7). Since zein protein contains many non-polar amino acids, and can be considered a hydrophobic protein, it is expected to have high water contact angle reported as in the range of 60 ° and 70 ° in the literature (Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2006a, Muthuselvi and Dhathathreyan, 2006). In our study, it was found that the addition of plasticizer decreased water contact angle of corn-zein coating. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of the coating layer decreased. The coating formulated with GLY had higher water contact angle compared to PEG plasticized film. This result was probably due to the strong hydrophilic interaction of PEG with water since PEG has higher molecular weight and hydrophilic nature than GLY. The increase in amount of plasticizer used in coating resulted in further decrease in water contact angle. The higher hydrophilic nature of coating formed by PEG plasticization was also confirmed by water vapor permeability (WVP) results of coated PP films. The higher WVP was obtained for PP films coated by PEG plasticized corn-zein compared to GLY plasticized films. Since hydrophobic nature of coating would increase with corn-zein concentration, the increase in water contact angle of the coating surface was observed as seen in Table 8. Hydrophobic coating on PP film decreased the surface energy of the coated films, along with decreasing water affinity by increasing the water contact angle. Similar results were obtained by several researchers (Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2006a, Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2006b, Muthuselvi and Dhathathreyan, 2006). Ghanbarzadeh and coworkers determined the effects of plasticizers on hydrophobicity of zein films. The addition of sugar plasticizers to free-standing zein films increased the surface tension of zein films, and resulted in reduction of water contact angle of zein films. However, no significant differences within ethanol and ethylene glycol contact angle of zein films were observed. Similar to our results, the zein films containing GLY had the highest water contact angle compared to other plasticized films (Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2006a). Muthuselvi and Dhathathreyan also found comparable results with this study. They observed significant decrease in contact angle of plasticized zein films compared to films of pure zein (Muthuselvi and Dhathathreyan, 2006). "

These films could provide a higher possibility in recycling processes because of easy separation of coating from the base plastic. The study was aimed at investigating the effects of coating formulation (corn-zein, ethanol, plasticizer concentration and type) on WVP and OP of coated PP films. The final corn-zein coated PP films showed good appearance, flexibility and adhesion between the coating and the base film. The WVP and OP of PP films significantly decreased by corn-zein coating depending on coating formulation. The improvement of water vapor barrier properties of PP coated films was obtained for high concentrations of corn-zein. In addition, the WVP of coated PP films increased with higher amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and glycerol (GLY) used as plasticizers because of the increase in free volume between polymer chains. The higher WVP of corn-zein coated PP films observed by plasticization of PEG as compared to GLY due to higher hydrophilicity of PEG. The coating improved OP of PP base film by showing nearly four times lower oxygen permeability than uncoated PP film. The excellent oxygen-barrier for coated PP films was obtained by applying coating solution which consists of higher amount corn-zein plasticized with GLY at low level. Therefore, it was observed that the corn-zein coated PP films showed tendency to have high water barrier with proper coating formulations especially high corn-zein content films plasticized with GLY. In conclusion, corn-zein coatings could have potential as an alternative to synthetic coating materials with appropriate formulation. "

1505,"Water vapor permeability, tensile properties and solubility of methylcellulose-based edible films.xml",['Introduction']," Shelf life of foods is governed by their numerous interactions with their surroundings and can be extended by using protective films. The deterioration of packaged foodstuffs largely depends on the transfers that may occur between the internal environment of the packaged food and the external environment. Edible films can be used to reduce water vapor, oxygen, lipid, and flavor migration between components of multicomponent food products, and between food and the surroundings. Many proteins and polysaccharides have good film-forming properties and can be used in the preparation of edible films (Greener & Fennema, 1994; Martin-Polo, 1995; McHugh & Krochta, 1994; Nisperos-Carriedo, 1994; Pérez-Gago, Nadaud, & Krochta, 1999; Torres, 1994; Zagory, 1995). Cellulose-derivative-based edible films are very efficient barriers to oxygen and aroma compounds. Water-soluble cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose (MC) are of interest to researchers because they are able to form a continuous matrix. MC is a cellulose ether that exhibits thermal gelation, forms excellent films, and is used in pharmaceutical and food industries (Donhowe & Fennema, 1993a). MC has been combined with lipids (Greener and Fennema, 1989a, Greener and Fennema, 1989b; Kamper & Fennema, 1984; Kester & Fennema, 1989; Koelsch & Labuza, 1992; Rico Pena & Torres, 1990) and polysaccharides (Kester & Fennema, 1989; Park & Chinnan, 1995) to make edible films that can serve as effective barriers to water vapor, oxygen and carbon dioxide. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) with various molecular weights (MWs) are effective plasticizers for MC films (Debeaufort & Voilley, 1997; Donhowe & Fennema, 1993b; Park, Weller, Vergano, & Testin, 1993). Several studies were carried out to determine water vapor permeability (WVP), tensile strength (TS) and% elongation (E) of MC-based films. The effects of physical and morphological properties and MW of PEG, temperature, ethanol concentration, and film thickness on WVP were investigated (Chinnan & Park, 1995; Donhowe and Fennema, 1993a, Donhowe and Fennema, 1993b; Kamper & Fennema, 1984; Koelsch & Labuza, 1992). The effects of relative humidity, temperature, film thickness, MW, and concentration of PEG on tensile properties were reported (Debeaufort & Voilley, 1997; Donhowe and Fennema, 1993a, Donhowe and Fennema, 1993b; Gennadios, Park, & Weller, 1993; Park et al., 1993). Moisture sorption behaviour of MC films was investigated by Ayrancı (1996), Chinnan and Park (1995), and Rico Pena and Torres (1990). Light transmittance properties were studied by Turhan and Şahbaz (2001). The objectives of this work were to study some aspects of MC-based films including WVP, tensile properties, adsorption isotherms, and solubility, as well as to evaluate the effects of film-forming solution composition and plasticizers on these properties.

For this purpose, films having MC concentration of 1.5, 3, 4, 5 and 6 g / 100 ml solvent (solvent=50% ethanol) were prepared (Table 1). As the MC concentration increased, the solution viscosity increased. The most viscous solution could be transferred onto the casting plates, but it spread with a little difficulty to form the film. Resulting films having initial MC concentration of 5 and 6 g / 100 ml were thicker, not transparent, had pinholes observed even by magnifying glass, and bubbles observed by polarized microscope. Their turbid appearance indicated incomplete solubilization of MC at high concentrations. They had low barrier and mechanical properties (Table 1). For example, the TS and% E of the film having 3 g MC / 100 ml solvent were 33±3 N / mm^2 and 14±1% , respectively. As the MC concentration increased to 6 g per 100 ml solvent, TS dropped to 8±1 N / mm^2 and% E to 6±2% . The decrease in mechanical properties with increasing MC concentration may be explained by the partial MC insolubility at high concentrations. On the other hand the films having 1.5 g MC / 100 ml solvent had low TS and E% which could be ascribed to the being thinnest among the other films. No significant difference was detected between WVP of films (Table 1). For this reason, 3 g / 100 ml solvent of MC concentration was selected for film preparation because of having the highest TS and E% within used concentrations. Effects of film-forming solution using an ethanol concentration of 25% , 50% , 67% and 75% in the solvent were investigated. As the ethanol concentration increased, it became difficult to spread films on the plate, and they became more opaque and brittle. Addition of PEG400 to the films (ethanol: 25-75% ) resulted in translucent and hazy films, but spreading was much easier. Whether the films contained PEG400 or not, the insoluble portion of MC was detected at high ethanol concentrations, even by the naked eye. The films prepared in 25% and 50% EtOH spread easily and no significant difference was detected between their WVP. But as the TS and% E of the film formed with 50% EtOH were 33±3 N / mm^2 and 14±1% , those of the film having 25% EtOH were 21±2 N / mm^2 and 11±2% , respectively. Therefore 50% ethanol was chosen as the solvent to investigate the effects of PEG, and its MW and concentration on the film properties. "

1518,"Water vapor permeability, tensile properties and solubility of methylcellulose-based edible films.xml","['Results and discussion', 'Adsorption isotherms']"," For most materials used for packaging, water vapor flux does not vary linearly with water vapor partial pressure gradient. Hydrophilic MC films exhibit nonlinear sorption curves (Ayrancı, 1996; Velázquez de la Cruz, Torres, & Martı́n-Polo, 2001). Consequently, permeability might be expected to depend on the relative humidity (52-0% ) to which the sample was exposed during testing. Ayrancı (1996) stated that the equilibrium moisture content approached to zero as the RH decreased below 35% , and at low water activities films did not adsorb water appreciably. Taking this point also into account, the adsorption isotherms of various films were determined at 25 °C over the RH range of 52-98% . The equilibrium moisture content of the films was low at RH=52% , and no significant difference was detected between them. Differences were notable as the PEG400 concentration increased (Fig. 1). In all films tested, equilibrium moisture content increased almost linearly up to an aw of 0.76-0.84, where a sharp increase was noted. It was concluded that plasticization by water did not occur over the relative humidity range of experimental conditions. Therefore Eq. (1) can be used to calculate WVP at relative humidity difference of 52-0% , which is in linear portion of the sorption curves. "

1520,"Water vapor permeability, tensile properties and solubility of methylcellulose-based edible films.xml","['Results and discussion', 'Water vapor permeability']"," The WVP of MC films was determined to be 0.232 × 10^-10-1.160 × 10^-10 g / m s Pa depending on the film composition. WVP of MC films was reported to be between 0.87 × 10^-10 and 1.47 × 10^-10 g / m s Pa (Chinnan & Park, 1995; Donhowe and Fennema, 1993a, Donhowe and Fennema, 1993b; Kester & Fennema, 1989; Park et al., 1993; Park & Chinnan, 1995). Experimental results were within the literature range. MC films are characteristically hydrophilic because of the functional hydroxyl groups they contain. Although MC is the least hydrophilic cellulose ether, MC films are still poor moisture barriers (Barrie, 1968; Biquet & Labuza, 1988; De Leiris, 1994; Kamper & Fennema, 1984; Pascat, 1985; Schwartzberg, 1985). For example, WVP of high and low density polyethylene films is 0.0022 × 10^-10 and 0.0087 × 10^-10 g / m s Pa, respectively (Guilbert & Biquet, 1996; Myers, Meyer, Rogers, Stannet, & Szwarc, 1961). WVP of experimental MC films were 25-500 times greater than those of synthetic films. However these films are better water vapor barriers than hydrophilic films based on starch, casein, and wheat gluten (Allen, Nelson, Steinberg, & McGill, 1963; Aydt, Weller, & Testin, 1991; Gontard & Guilbert, 1994; Greener & Fennema, 1989b; Kester & Fennema, 1989; Schultz, Miers, Owens, & Maclay, 1949). The WVP of films with or without PEG400 and the effects of ethanol concentration in the film-forming solution were compared (Table 2). Column two shows that WVP increased significantly as the ethanol concentration increased. Ethanol is added to film-forming solutions, because it allows a reduction in drying time due to its low boiling point (78 °C) and does not remain in the film after drying. Therefore it does not strongly modify the structure of the polymer (Debeaufort & Voilley, 1997; Turhan et al., 2001). The ethanol concentration, on the other hand, affects the solubility of MC, as evident from the turbid appearance of films at high ethanol concentrations indicating incomplete solubilization. The viscosity of these film-forming solutions was high, which made the removal of air bubbles difficult, and pinholes were formed. An increase in ethanol concentration increased WVP. Similar results were reported in a previous work (Pérez-Gago et al., 1999). However, no significant difference in WVP was found between films prepared with 0-67% ethanol concentrations in the presence of PEG400 (Table 2, third column). This result suggests that the plasticizing effect of PEG400 overcame the difficulties arising from the decreasing solubility of MC as ethanol concentration increased. In fact, addition of PEG400 made the spreading easier, and much smoother films were obtained. Addition of plasticizers to the polymer matrix results in an increase in WVP. But two different behaviors were observed in MC films. Incorporation of PEG400 to the polymer matrix resulted in an increase in WVP at low ethanol concentrations but had no effect at high concentrations. This later result indicated that incomplete solubilization of MC still appeared as the controlling factor on the film structure; therefore, effect of PEG400 was not observed at high ethanol concentrations. The increase in WVP with increasing PEG400 concentration is presented in Table 3. Addition of PEGs with various MWs resulted in increased WVP, although no difference was noted between their WVPs (Table 3). These were all expected results because PEG incorporated to the polymer matrix decreased the attractive forces between MC chains, increased free volume and segmental motions, hence water molecules diffused more easily and higher WVP resulted. That the formation of hydrogen bonding between MC and PEG occurred, reducing intermolecular attraction between MC-MC chains, was also proven by the FTIR studies (Turhan et al., 2001). "

1527,"Water vapor permeability, tensile properties and solubility of methylcellulose-based edible films.xml","['Results and discussion', 'Tensile properties']"," TS of MC films was determined to be 17-44 N / mm^2 and% E between 14 and 97 depending on the film composition. Mechanical properties for MC films were compared as related to presence of ethanol concentration and PEG400 (Table 4). The highest TS was observed in the film prepared with water, and addition of ethanol and PEG400 decreased TS. Increasing PEG400 concentration reduced TS, but no significant change was noted in the case of MW increase (Table 3). The high TS values, observed in the films prepared with water or water-ethanol, were attributed to the numerous hydrogen bonds between MC chains. These bonds contribute to cohesiveness and low flexibility of unplasticized films (Turhan et al., 2001). When PEG is incorporated in the MC network, a competition for hydrogen bonding between MC-MC and MC-PEG occurs. As a result, direct interactions between MC chains are reduced partly due to hydrogen bond formation with PEG or partly by the blocking effect of high-molecular-weight PEGs. The concentration of PEG400 also significantly increased the hydrogen bond formation. This was strongly in accordance with the present observation that increasing PEG400 concentration decreased TS, due to increase of hydrogen bonding. Therefore PEGs reduce intermolecular attraction by forming hydrogen bonds between MC chains or by blocking the chains, allowing more flexibility and decreasing TS. The incorporation of PEG to the polymer matrix increased% E (Table 4). While the increase in MW of PEG decreased% E slightly, the most profound factor on% E appeared as the PEG concentration (Table 3). Effects of PEG400 concentration on TS and% E were different (Table 3). These differences correspond to the glass transition of the polymer, which affects% E more than TS (Debeaufort & Voilley, 1997). Depending on the stress-strain curves, they classified MC-based films into 4 groups. Using their work and the stress-strain curves obtained in this research, the films containing no PEG were classified as brittle and in the glassy state. When PEG was incorporated, the resulting polymers were classified as pseudoductile. Increases in% E mainly occur when films become rubbery, i.e., when structure changes from ductile to elastic (Debeaufort & Voilley, 1997). The% E increased significantly with the PEG400 content. At high PEG400 concentrations, the polymer deforms homogeneously by viscous processes, given a large extension to failure. This also was observed from the shape of stress-strain curves. Table 3 shows that MW of PEG did not affect WVP and TS of the films, but% E decreased slightly as the MW of PEG increased. This can be attributed to the heterogeneous film structure arising from the decrease of solubility and miscibility of high-molecular-weight PEGs. "

1531,"Water vapor permeability, tensile properties and solubility of methylcellulose-based edible films.xml","['Results and discussion', 'Film solubility']"," Solubility in water is an important property of edible films. Potential applications may require water insolubility to enhance product integrity and water resistance. However, in some cases film water solubility before consumption of the product might be benefical (Pérez-Gago et al., 1999). The solubility of MC depends on its degree of substitution (DS), and MC used in this research (DS=1.9) was reported as water-soluble (Kirk & Othmer, 1963-1972). The dissolution of a hydrophilic polymer such as MC involves the penetration of water to the polymer bulk and swelling. This is followed by disruption of hydrogen and Van der Walls forces between polymer chains. Chemical degradation leading to the creation of oligomers and monomers occurs via hydrolysis or enzyme-catalysed hydrolysis (Göpferich, 1996). Since the hydrolysis of etheric bonds in MC was not possible in basic solution such as the phosphate buffer (pH=7.4), MC was only hydrated and dissolved in this buffer. Films prepared only with water or water / ethanol dissolved slowly, whereas plasticized film pieces dissolved rapidly after coming into contact with water (Fig. 2). The low dissolution rate indicated the high cohesion of MC matrix via numerous hydrogen bonds between MC-MC chains (Turhan et al., 2001). This effect of hydrogen bonding also was observed in tensile properties. The increase in dissolution rate by the addition of PEG400 was due to the disruption of native three-dimensional structure of MC through hydrogen bond formation with PEG400. This result also was supported by experiments during which the concentration of PEG400 significantly increased the solution rate. This observation was in accordance with the report that intermolecular hydrogen bonds between MC-MC chains were replaced by hydrogen bonds with PEG400 (Turhan et al., 2001). As a result, the solvation of polar sites on the MC chains and reduced intermolecular attraction may be accountable for increased film water-solubility. Fig. 3 shows that% SM decreased as the MW of PEG increased. This may have resulted from the solubility and hydrophilicity differences between PEG molecules, since both properties decrease with an increase in MW. In addition, higher numbers of edge groups in low MW PEGs enable faster flow of water in the polymer matrix, resulting in higher dissolution rates. "

Increasing PEG400 concentration increased WVP and% E and decreased TS, but its effect was most pronounced on% E. This was attributed to the glass transition of the polymer to rubbery state. The films containing PEG had higher solubility, and solubility decreased as the MW of PEG increased. Structural differences between plasticized and unplasticized films were explained in terms of hydrogen bonding between PEG and MC chains or a blocking effect in the case of high-MW PEGs. "

1542,Water vapour permeability of poly(lactic acid) nanocomposites.xml,['Introduction']," Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a compostable thermoplastic that is synthesised from lactic acid, which is derived from renewable resources. It is one of the most commercially successful of the bio-derived polymers and is widely used in biomedical applications because of its biocompatibility and also in packaging and other short-life disposable products [1]. Lactic acid is first produced by the fermentation of a carbohydrate feedstock, such as maize sugar, and is then extracted and polymerised. PLA, also known as poly(lactide), is produced commercially by ring-opening polymerisation of the lactide, which is a cyclic dimer composed of two lactic acid units [1], [2]. Lactic acid contains an asymmetric carbon atom and therefore exists in two optically active isomers (d and l). Hence three optically isomeric forms of lactide are possible: l-lactide (a dimer of l-lactic acid), d-lactide (a dimer of d-lactic acid) and meso-lactide (a dimer of l-and d-lactic acid). The crystallisable content of PLA is determined by the ratio of l-, d-and meso-lactide in the polymer: higher crystallinities are obtained with the more optically pure polymers because of their higher chain symmetry. Although compostable polymers provide added advantages in terms of end-of-life disposal and would seem to be ideal for food packaging and disposable items, they often have poor technical performance in terms of both mechanical and barrier properties compared with conventional thermoplastics. It is unsurprising that compostable / biodegradable polymers have relatively high water vapour permeabilities given that they are polar polymers with relatively high values of water vapour solubility, and water permeability in polymer films is usually dominated by the solubility of water in the polymer. For example, Shogren [3] has measured the water vapour transmission rates (WVTR) of a number of biodegradable polymers and demonstrated a correlation between WVTR and water solubility, together with crystallinity and the effect of the glass transition temperature (Tg). Hydrolysis reactions should also be considered because this is essentially the mechanism by which degradation takes place. PLA is well established in biomedical applications by virtue of its biocompatibility and biodegradability. It is a polyester and undergoes hydrolysis reactions in which the ester bonds are cleaved and molecular weight is reduced. This process can take place in the presence of water alone but it is greatly accelerated by catalysts such as enzymes. Siparsky et al. [4] investigated hydrolysis in PLA films at 90% relative humidity and at temperatures between 20 and 50 °C and demonstrated that hydrolysis in PLA films is a very slow process compared with water vapour diffusion. Improvement in barrier properties is one of the most notable successes of polymer / clay nanocomposites. Some quite dramatic reductions in permeability with relatively low additions of nanoclay have been reported. For example, Yano et al. [5] synthesised polyimide-clay nanocomposites with four different sizes of clay mineral to examine the effect of the size of the filler particles on the barrier properties. The minerals investigated were hectorite, saponite, montmorillonite and synthetic mica. It was found that the longer the length of clay mineral, the greater the improvement in barrier properties. In the case of the polyimide-mica composite, an addition of only 2 wt% of synthetic mica reduced the permeability coefficient of water vapour to a value less than one-tenth of that of the unfilled polyimide. It is generally accepted that the reason for the observed improvements in barrier properties (to both water vapour and gases) is the so-called ‘tortuous path’ model in which gas or liquid molecules have a greatly increased diffusion path length due to the obstacle imposed by the impervious clay platelets. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is assumed that rectangular clay platelets are aligned perpendicular to the diffusion direction. This model was first proposed and quantified by Nielsen [6]. The Nielsen equation is given in Eq. (1), where Pc is the permeability of the polymer composite, Pm is the permeability of the unfilled polymer matrix, Vf is the volume fraction of filler and L / D is the aspect ratio (length / thickness) of the filler.(1)PcPm=1-Vf1+(L / 2D)Vf Choudalakis and Gotsis [7] have reviewed a large number of studies on the gaseous permeability of polymer nanocomposites, including a number of other models proposed to predict permeability. A common feature of the various models is that the relative permeability depends on the volume fraction of the nanofiller, the aspect ratio of the platelets and their orientation. The relative permeability seems to be independent of both the gas species and the polymer type in the matrix. It is concluded that where the geometric parameters of the polymer nanocomposite system are known, then the Nielsen model, which is the simplest, is reasonably successful in predicting permeability. PLA nanocomposites have been reported to give improvements in mechanical properties, barrier properties and biodegradability [8], [9]. For example, Ray et al. [10] have found significant improvements in storage modulus with increasing nanoclay loadings in dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) tests carried out over a wide temperature range. The enhancement of modulus is due to the reinforcing effect of incorporating a high modulus platy filler to a lower modulus polymer. The improvement in modulus was not found to hinder biodegradability. In fact a significant improvement in biodegradability after nanoclay preparation has been observed [11]. The gas barrier properties of PLA nanocomposites have been reported by a number of workers [10], [12], [13], [14], [15]. In particular oxygen barrier is highly relevant for food packaging applications. Oxygen permeability is reported to be reduced by values of around 25% [12], [13], 48% [15], 55% [14] and up to 80% [10] depending on the type and amount of nanoclay added, as well as its dispersion and aspect ratio in the PLA composite film. There are a limited number of studies on the water vapour permeability of PLA nanocomposites. Thellen et al. [15] have reported a 50% improvement in water vapour barrier compared with neat PLA when a loading of 5 wt% nanoclay was used to make PLA nanocomposites that were prepared by twin-screw extrusion and converted to blown films. Zenkiewicz and Richert [14] found the best result was a 60% decrease in water vapour permeability of a PLA nanocomposite containing 5 wt% nanoclay to which 20 wt% PMMA had been added. Rhim et al. [16] prepared PLA nanocomposites with increasing amounts of Cloisite 20A by solvent casting. It was found that with a high clay loading of 13 wt% , the improvement in water vapour barrier was around 67% . The purpose of this study is to investigate whether water permeation through PLA / clay nanocomposites can be quantified in terms of a tortuous path model. PLA nanocomposites containing from 1 up to 6 wt% of montmorillonite layered silicate are prepared by melt compounding followed by compression moulding. The morphology, thermal properties and water vapour transmission rates of these nanocomposites are investigated. This study examines how nanoclay concentration and dispersion affect the water vapour barrier properties of poly(lactic acid). Transmission electron microscopy is used to examine the alignment of the clay platelets and measure their aspect ratio. The results are then interpreted in terms of a tortuous path model. "

In the trace from the PLA nanocomposite, it is seen that the peak has shifted to give a 2θ value of 2.6 °. This corresponds to an interlayer spacing of 34 Å and thus demonstrates a widening of the clay interplanar spacing, showing that intercalation has occurred. This result is in agreement with other published WAXD data for PLA nanocomposites. For example, Thellen et al. [15] reported that the interplanar spacing in montmorillonite layered silicates was 18.7 Å and this increased to 32 Å in PLA nanocomposites produced by blown film extrusion. McLauchlin and Thomas [17] have reported that Cloisite^® 30B organoclay has an interplanar spacing of 18.1 Å and this increased to 34.8 Å in intercalated PLA nanocomposites produced by solvent casting.

These micrographs indicate that the clay particles are well dispersed and have become aligned in the flow direction when the polymer melt was sheared between the two rotors in the torque rheometer, and that the orientation is maintained when the melt is pressed into the sheet samples. The intercalated nanocomposite structure is shown in more detail in Fig. 4, which is a micrograph of a 3 wt% nanoclay sample at 100k magnification. The lines in the micrograph are the edges of the clay platelets. A more detailed view of the clay platelet structure can be seen in Fig. 5. This shows a 5 wt% nanoclay sample at 200k magnification. The corner and edges of the clay platelet structure are clearly visible. Image processing software was used to determine that the thickness of a single clay platelet was 1.6 nm. The average length of the nanoclay platelets within the PLA matrix was measured from the TEM micrographs using Image J^® software. The average value of the length for concentrations of clay of 3 wt% was found to be 80 nm. Hence the average aspect ratio (length / thickness) was taken as 50 and this was the value used in subsequent tortuosity calculations. "

1556,Water vapour permeability of poly(lactic acid) nanocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)']"," Fig. 6 shows the DSC first heating scan for amorphous PLA, grade 4060D. The step change at 55 °C corresponds to the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer. The peak just after the step change represents an enthalpic relaxation peak. This has been reported for PLA by other workers [13], [15], [18] and is ascribed to relaxation of non-equilibrium structure. It is clear from Fig. 6 that there is no cold crystallisation temperature (Tc) and neither is there any melting point (Tm), thus confirming the amorphous nature of the samples. The DSC scans for all the PLA 4060D nanocomposites were the same as Fig. 6, with an average Tg in the range 55±1 °C. It was concluded that there was no significant change in glass transition temperature due to the presence of the nanoclay. Again this is in agreement with the findings on PLA nanocomposites of some previous studies [11], [13], [15], [18]. Fig. 7 shows the DSC trace (first heating scan) for the crystallisable PLA, grade 4032D. In this case the Tg is 58 °C and there is no enthalpic relaxation peak. The exothermic peak at 111 °C corresponds to cold crystallisation i.e. crystallisation on heating above the Tg. There is a double melting peak at temperatures of 163 and 169 °C. The lower peak corresponds to melting of the α' phase, which is the disordered crystalline form [19], whereas the higher temperature peak corresponds to melting of the α phase, which is the ordered crystalline form. Nanocomposites made from the crystallisable grade of PLA were found to have slightly different DSC heating scans from the virgin polymer, as shown in Fig. 8, which is the DSC heating scan for the PLA nanocomposite with 5 wt% of nanoclay. Here it can be seen that although the Tg is still at 58 °C, the temperature of the cold crystallisation peak has reduced to 98 °C. Also the double melting peak has largely disappeared being replaced by one peak at the higher melting temperature, corresponding to the ordered crystalline form. However, there is a small exothermic peak at 154 °C corresponding to a change of crystal morphology before melting. These small peaks were found in the DSC traces of all the PLA 4032D nanocomposites at temperatures of 155±1 °C. Table 1 summarises the DSC data from the PLA 4032D nanocomposites. It can be seen that there is no significant change in glass transition temperature (Tg) with addition of nanoclay, as found for the amorphous PLA. There is, however, a significant reduction in the cold crystallisation temperature (Tc). This indicates that the nanoclay platelets can facilitate nucleation of PLA crystallites. Furthermore, the disappearance of the lower temperature melting point (Tm) with the addition of nanoclay indicates that the nanoclay particles promote formation of the ordered crystalline phase. "

1561,Water vapour permeability of poly(lactic acid) nanocomposites.xml,"['Results and discussion', 'Water vapour permeability measurements']"," Water vapour transmission rates (WVTR) as measured through the PLA sheets processed from the amorphous polymer, 4060D, and those from the crystallisable PLA, 4032D, are shown in Table 2. Four samples were measured for each data point. It is found from both data sets that there is a significant reduction in WVTR with increasing clay content, which starts to level off at clay additions above 5 wt% . Both data sets are plotted in Fig. 9, where it is seen that there is good reproducibility between the two polymers. As discussed above, although 4032D is a crystallisable grade of PLA, samples were cooled quickly in the compression moulding machine and so significant crystallisation did not take place. Hence the reduction in permeability is due to the effect of the nanoclay. For a 5 wt% addition of nanoclay, there was found to be a reduction in WVTR of 40% . This result compares with data reported by Thellen et al. [15], who incorporated 5 wt% of organically modified montmorillonite into plasticised PLA blown films and reported a 50% improvement in water vapour barrier. The effect of nanoclay on the barrier properties of polymers can be quantified by the ‘tortuous path’ theory due to Nielsen [6], which, as previously discussed is the generally accepted explanation of observed reductions in permeability due to platey fillers. The Nielsen equation is given in Eq. (1), which was used to predict the water vapour permeability of the PLA composites given that the aspect ratio is 50, the density of PLA is 1.24 g / cm^3 and the density of the montmorillonite is 1.98 g / cm^3. The values predicted from the Nielsen model are compared with the measured values in the plot of permeability versus clay volume fraction in Fig. 10. The trend line predicted by the Nielsen model lies just below that of the experimental data. Hence the experimental data give a reasonably good fit to the Nielsen model, which predicts the maximum improvement in barrier properties, assuming that the clay platelets are 100% intercalated or exfoliated and perfectly aligned.

1565,Water vapour permeability of poly(lactic acid) nanocomposites.xml,['Conclusions']," PLA nanocomposites containing from 1 up to 6 wt% of montmorillonite layered silicate have been prepared by melt compounding followed by compression moulding. It was confirmed that the nanocomposite structures were intercalated using both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Results from WAXD analysis showed that the clay interlayer spacing increased from 1.84 to 3.4 nm. TEM micrographs indicated that the clay particles were well dispersed and aligned in the flow direction of the polymer melt. Using image processing software it was found that the thickness of a single clay platelet was 1.6 nm. The average length of the nanoclay platelets within the PLA matrix was measured from the TEM micrographs and found to be 80 nm, thus giving an average aspect ratio (length / thickness) of 50. The DSC data showed that the addition of nanoclay had no effect on the glass transition temperature (Tg) of either amorphous or crystallisable PLA. However, there was a significant reduction in the cold crystallisation temperature (Tc), indicating that the nanoclay platelets facilitated nucleation of PLA crystallites. The disappearance of the lower temperature melting point (Tm) with addition of nanoclay also showed that the nanoclay particles promoted formation of the ordered crystalline phase. Measured values of water vapour permeability of the PLA nanocomposites were compared with values from the Nielsen tortuosity model. The trend line predicted by the Nielsen model lay just below that of the experimental data, showing a reasonably good fit given that the model assumes that the clay platelets are 100% intercalated or exfoliated and perfectly aligned.
